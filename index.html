            Chapter 500: Sword Daoist, Damaged Emperor Weapon, The Nine Heavens
            Orthodoxies’ Strategy
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            “Brother, feel free to state your requests. The Wu clan will make
            sure to contribute everything we can within our capacity.”
          </p>
          <p>The Wu Clan Leader was quick to agree.</p>
          <p>
            He knew that Chu Kuangren’s power was far more terrifying than the
            other clans.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Wu clan was probably an insignificant orthodoxy in Chu
            Kuangren’s perspective. If he wanted to, he could obliterate them at
            any moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The power difference was so big that the Wu Clan Leader did not even
            think of resisting at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that was the case, there was no harm in playing along with Chu
            Kuangren’s demands.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Chu Kuangren had saved the Wu clan and his life, the Wu Clan
            Leader felt that this was a great opportunity to turn the situation
            around.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It looks like you know how to play your cards well.” Chu Kuangren
            nodded, content with the clan leader’s attitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            “First, I’ve got a few questions to ask. Is this the Emperor Road?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Wu Clan Leader was confused. He did not expect Chu Kuangren to
            pose such a question. However, the Wu Clan Leader was quick to
            recall an important fact and hastily answered, “Yes.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Are you born and raised in the Emperor Road, or did you come from
            somewhere else?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “We were born in the Emperor Road and are considered a local
            institution. However, there are also many powerful entities in the
            Emperor Road who came from the outside world.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Wu Clan Leader could gauge Chu Kuangren’s origin and did not
            intend to conceal any matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Very well. Lastly, I require some information about the Emperor
            Road, including information about the region’s power dynamics,
            sky-prides, and matters relating to the Emperor’s Throne.”
          </p>
          <p>“Understood.”</p>
          <p>
            The Wu Clan Leader nodded and arranged a guest room for Chu
            Kuangren. He had never once mentioned the Divine Emerald Lamp
            throughout their conversation.
          </p>
          <p>In the Wu clan’s grand hall, several elders were congregating.</p>
          <p>“Clan Leader, what should we do next?”</p>
          <p>“Let’s just stick to his demands and see what pans out.”</p>
          <p>“What about the Divine Emerald Lamp then?”</p>
          <p>
            “If he’s unwilling to return it, do you think we stand a chance in
            getting it back?” The Wu Clan Leader rolled his eyes and said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, his eyes glimmered with a sense of excitement. “I believe
            you’ve heard that the Emperor Mountain has undergone a strange
            transformation. The Emperors’ Thrones are reappearing. This means
            that the Emperor Road is now connected to the outside world. This
            person is likely a sky-pride from the outside world, who’s
            participating in the fight for the Emperor’s Throne. Nay, he must
            be!”
          </p>

          <p>
            “Besides, you’ve also witnessed his capability, how he defeated the
            Sage Rulers with ease. Not even the outlawed sky-prides of the
            Emperor Road are capable of it. How strong must his orthodoxy be for
            it to birth such a formidable cultivator? It must be many times
            stronger than the Wu clan.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Wu clan has been suffering from a severe lack of talent these
            years. We’re unfated to ascend into the Emperor Throne. We can only
            benefit from making his acquaintance. If this person manages to
            ascend into the throne, it’ll mean that we’ve made the acquaintance
            of an Emperor. This alone will ensure that the Wu clan will
            prosper.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The council contemplated deeply at the Wu Clan Leader’s explanation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the likelihood of a person becoming an Emperor was slim, it
            was still possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides, there was not much they could do other than avoid getting
            at Chu Kuangren’s wrong side at all costs.
          </p>
          <p>“We understand now.”</p>
          <p>
            Then, the elders followed Chu Kuangren’s demand and went on to
            prepare a list of intel about the Emperor Road.
          </p>
          <p>In the Wu clan’s guest room.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren recollected his spiritual thought. “They’re smart
            enough to avoid playing tricks on me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He needed a local entity to prepare the information for him, and he
            could not ask for anything better than the Wu clan’s allegiance.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Emperor Road’s structure is built differently than the outside
            world. It looks like I may need some time to get used to it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren noticed that his spiritual thought was not his only
            ability that got restricted. His Spatial Conveyor Skill was just as
            affected as well, all because the Emperor Road’s spatial structure
            significantly differed from the outside world. As such, Chu Kuangren
            needed some time to adjust himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, his other combat strength still remained unaffected.
            This was enough for him to deal with what was about to come.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Stone City, Zhang clan.</p>
          <p>
            The Sage Rulers who had just returned from the Wu clan were
            congregating.
          </p>
          <p>
            “D*mn it. Our entire plan has been ruined by a person who just
            appeared out of nowhere. Now that we don’t have the Divine Emerald
            Lamp, I wonder how that entity will punish us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Zhang Clan Leader said. At the mention of that entity, a sense
            of fear flashed in his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It is unfortunate that we didn’t get the Divine Emerald Lamp, but
            the youngster was just too strong for all of us. He could easily
            kill a Sage Ruler. With that level of ability, I’m afraid only the
            entity has the means to deal with him. This is out of our hands.
            It’s best that we speak honestly with him.”
          </p>
          <p>Qian Clan Leader said as he attended to his severed limb.</p>
          <p>
            A brief encounter with Chu Kuangren was enough to leave him
            traumatized.
          </p>
          <p>“That seems like our only option now.”</p>
          <p>
            The Zhang Clan Leader took out a transparent crystal ball, which
            emitted a glow that manifested into an apparition in the void.
          </p>
          <p>
            The apparition was blurry, but one could tell that the figure of the
            apparition was dressed in a majestic golden robe. Despite it being
            his apparition only, the figure still managed to exert an unbearable
            aura within the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Greetings, Sword Daoist,” the Zhang Clan Leader quickly bowed and
            greeted the person.
          </p>

          <p>“Is the matter done?”</p>
          <p>The entity that was known as the Sword Daoist spoke.</p>
          <p>
            The clan leaders could only look at each other. None of them dared
            utter a word.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist could induce the results from their silence and
            said furiously, “Speak. What happened?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Everything was going as planned at first. However, just when we’re
            about to get our hands on the Divine Emerald Lamp...” The Zhang Clan
            Leader narrated the entire incident to the Sword Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist went silent for a moment before he screamed
            abruptly, “Useless!”
          </p>
          <p>“Please forgive us, Sword Daoist.”</p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, I’m occupied by other matters for now, so I’ll send a few
            swordsmen over to complete the affair tomorrow.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “If the Master Swordsmen will come to assist, then the matter should
            be considered done,” said the Zhang Clan Leader as he quickly bowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If anything funny happens again this time, it’ll be the end of all
            your clans.”
          </p>
          <p>With a snort, the Sword Daoist vanished.</p>
          <p>
            The clan leaders could not help but turn white when they heard the
            Sword Daoist’s final remark.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With the assistance from the Master Swordsmen, this shouldn’t be a
            problem.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s right, let’s not worry too much about it now.”</p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>In the Wu clan.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was toying around with the Divine Emerald Lamp when he
            noticed that the Emperor Weapon was damaged.
          </p>
          <p>He noticed that there was no wick in the lantern.</p>
          <p>
            “A damaged Emperor Weapon is of little use to me. If the Wu clan
            puts up a decent performance, I might just consider returning this
            to them.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren murmured.</p>
          <p>
            At that instance, the Wu Clan Leader knocked on the door to his
            room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren stored the Divine Emerald Lamp and said, “Come in.”
          </p>
          <p>“Greetings, Brother Chu.”</p>
          <p>“How’s everything going so far?”</p>
          <p>
            “This is the map of the Emperor Road and all the information about
            its sky-prides and powerful cultivators.”
          </p>
          <p>The Wu Clan Leader then took out a jade scroll.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren activated his spiritual thought and glimpsed through
            the content. He noticed that there was a significant overlap between
            the information provided by the Wu Clan Leader and the divine
            predictor.
          </p>
          <p>
            He pondered deeply. “It looks like the past ancient and even archaic
            orthodoxies had established their power foundations throughout the
            Emperor Road a long time ago. Interesting. So apart from the
            sky-prides, I’ll also have to deal with these orthodoxies in the
            Emperor Road. No wonder the divine predictor has given me so much
            information about the Nine Heavens.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>
            Chapter 501: The Sword Tribe’s People Arrives, Seven-Colored
            Swordsmen, It’s With Me
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            After asking about the Emperor Road, Chu Kuangren inquired further
            about the Divine Emerald Lamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wu Clan Leader did not try to be secretive about it either as he
            started to explain to Chu Kuangren about the chronicles of the
            Divine Emerald Lamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It has been common knowledge since long ago that the Divine Emerald
            Lamp is in the Wu Clan’s possession, so I don’t think it’s really a
            secret. However, the truth is that this Emperor Weapon is currently
            in an incomplete state. It can only be used with the Wu clan’s
            secret technique of using a cultivator’s blood essence to fuel it.
            Hence, the other clans were not too concerned about this Emperor
            Weapon. It’s just that, for some reason, they have recently decided
            to turn their attention to this Divine Emerald Lamp. They even went
            as far as bribing our Wu Clan Senior Elder.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wu Clan Leader appeared a little perplexed as well when he came to
            this part of the story.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren, on the other hand, looked deep in thought.</p>
          <p>
            An incomplete Emperor Weapon, one that required one’s own blood
            essence or even life as the cost to activate it. No wonder those
            people were not interested in it at first.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it was a completed Emperor Weapon, that would be a whole
            different story.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What if they are able to make the Divine Emerald Lamp whole again?”
            A bright spark flashed past Chu Kuangren’s mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            This could explain why the Zhang clan, the Qian clan, and the other
            clans had a sudden interest in the Divine Emerald Lamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            There could even be a mastermind pulling the strings behind all of
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Right. There’s also another rumor about this Divine Emerald Lamp.
            Legend has it that this divine lamp is connected to Sword Emperor
            Qingxuan from a few centuries ago.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wu Clan Leader suddenly remembered a fable that had been passed down
            in the clan for generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, a connection to a Sword Emperor,” Chu Kuangren replied, with
            his interest now piqued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Exactly. The Divine Emerald Lamp’s owner, Emperor Qingli was Sword
            Emperor Qingxuan’s Daoist companion. But after Sword Emperor Qinxuan
            went into closed-door meditation in the Emperor Road, there was no
            news of him. Rumor has it that he died in his closed-door
            meditation. It’s said that only Emperor Qingli knows the method of
            looking for him and that this method involves the Divine Emerald
            Lamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Nevertheless, these were mere folklore during the ancient times.
            Nobody has any solid evidence to prove either of that.” Wu Clan
            Leader shook his head and smiled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Whether it’s true or not, we’ll find out after we make the Divine
            Emerald Lamp whole again.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren initially planned to return this Emperor Weapon to the
            Wu clan, but now, he scrapped that idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            An incomplete Emperor Weapon was of no use for him, but he could not
            say the same when it was complete again. Moreover, it involved the
            existence of a Sword Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>The next day.</p>
          <p>
            After a long night’s study, Chu Kuangren was almost done organizing
            all the information he had gotten about the Emperor Road.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914dfd5ed68b00364a4a98",
                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            The key information among all that was the Emperor Mountain at the
            end of the Emperor Road!
          </p>
          <p>That was where the Emperor’s Throne resided.</p>
          <p>
            Ever since the Emperor Road was closed off, Emperor Mountain had not
            produced an Emperor’s Throne for over a hundred and fifty thousand
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, an incredibly powerful Emperor’s Aura had surged out from
            Emperor Mountain. The whole mountain was enveloped by an unknown
            force, and nobody was allowed to go near it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such a strange phenomenon was usually a sign that Emperor Mountain
            was about to produce an Emperor’s Throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            This had made all the living beings on Emperor Road go crazy as they
            all prepared to fight for the Emperor’s Throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Emperor’s Throne on Emperor Mountain is a symbol of
            Emperorhood. This concerns not just the sky-prides from Nine Heavens
            and the Underworld, but also the native sky-prides of Emperor Road
            and all those others who hail from the archaic or past ancient
            orthodoxies. Hah, this Race to Emperorhood is already at its crucial
            moment. It’s getting increasingly more exciting now.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren gripped the Descendant Self Sword in one hand and
            continued, “I hope that my next few opponents will be somewhat
            interesting. Otherwise, walking all the way to the end of this
            Emperor Road by myself will be too lonely and boring.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Descendant Self Sword gently vibrated, as if it understood its
            owner’s sentiments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that instant, all cultivators of the Wu clan felt themselves
            shudder, after which they checked their surroundings with curious
            glances.
          </p>
          <p>“Wu Clan Leader, show yourself!”</p>
          <p>Just then, a loud shriek echoed above the Wu clan.</p>
          <p>
            Following that, a chilly Sword-based Daoist Rhyme swept across the
            room with great speed, covering the entire Wu clan.
          </p>
          <p>That was a Sage Ruler Poise!</p>
          <p>One of the most elite Sage Rulers at that!</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren, who was still inside his room, looked outside the
            window. “Oh, that was fast.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He was not surprised at all. The fact that several major clans were
            fighting for the Divine Emerald Lamp surely meant there was some
            elaborate scheming going on and a mastermind behind all of this.
            Since the major clans failed, that mastermind would surely send more
            people to get it if he or she was unwilling to give up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above the Wu clan, besides Zhang Clan Leader, Qian Clan Leader, and
            a few other Sage Rulers from yesterday, there were also several
            extremely imposing swordsmen.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing worth noting was that each one of these swordsmen wore
            different colored clothing.
          </p>
          <p>Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple.</p>
          <p>
            Wu Clan Leader and the rest of them looked flabbergasted when they
            saw these few swordsmen.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s them!! Why are they here?!”</p>
          <p>“No! Why would we be targeted by these guys?”</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>Looks of despair were seen on each Wu clan member’s face.</p>
          <p>
            These few swordsmen in front of them now were not exactly the most
            elite swordsmen of Emperor Road, but their presence represented the
            involvement of one of Emperor Road’s most feared forces!
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Sword Tribe! What did we do to get the Sword Tribe on our
            trails?!”
          </p>
          <p>One of the elders was shocked.</p>
          <p>
            Neither one of them could answer him as they were all similarly
            dumbfounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wu Clan Leader took a deep breath. He had long guessed that there
            was a mastermind instructing the Zhang clan and the other clans to
            do this. However, he did not expect it to be the Sword Tribe!
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Seven-colored Swordsmen. These are the highest-end swordsmen
            that a Sword Tribe member could get as their bodyguards. Within the
            Sword Tribe, only the Sword Tribe Daoist is eligible to receive such
            a high-end treatment. I have never expected the person who is
            targeting us to be not just any Sword Tribe member, but one of the
            top-ranked ones — that notorious outlawed sky-pride, Sword Daoist!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wu Clan Leader proclaimed before he suppressed the fear in him and
            slowly walked out.
          </p>
          <p>He had to face this no matter what.</p>
          <p>
            “Greetings, fellow esteemed members of the Sword Tribe. I’m the Wu
            Clan Leader. Is there anything that I can help you with?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hand out the Divine Emerald Lamp, or we’ll obliterate the Wu clan!”
          </p>
          <p>
            That swordsman in red robes threatened him. When the word
            ‘obliterate’ was spoken, a brutal Sword-based Daoist Rhyme gushed
            out. It felt as though it had transformed into fine, invisible sword
            qis that swept across the entire Wu clan. This Daoist Rhyme made the
            Wu clan cultivators’ scalps tingle, whereas the weaker ones trembled
            so much that they knelt on the floor.
          </p>
          <p>“Divine Emerald Lamp...”</p>
          <p>
            “As I have thought. It wasn’t the Zhang clan or the Qian clan who
            wanted the Divine Emerald Lamp. It was the Sword Tribe.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The only question is, why are they looking for this divine lamp? Is
            it because of that unproven rumor about Sword Emperor Qingxuan?”
          </p>
          <p>Wu Clan Leader kept thinking, but he was helpless at that.</p>
          <p>
            If he knew from the beginning that his opponent was someone as
            powerful as the Sword Tribe, he would have given up the Divine
            Emerald Lamp long ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Tribe must have felt it was unnecessary to deal with the
            Wu clan themselves, so they sent the Zhang clan and the Qian clan to
            do their biddings. However, they did not expect that someone like
            Chu Kuangren would be here, so they had no choice but to send the
            Seven-colored Swordsmen. However, the Divine Emerald Lamp was not in
            the Wu Clan Leader’s hands either.
          </p>
          <p>“Why? Do you plan to rebel against us?”</p>
          <p>
            The Red Swordsman looked at Wu Clan Leader with hostility when he
            saw that he was silent.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Master Swordsman, that Divine Emerald Lamp is currently not with
            us,” Wu Clan Leader explained.
          </p>
          <p>“Then, where is it?”</p>
          <p>“It’s with me.”</p>
          <p>
            Before Wu Clan Leader could give an answer, a white-robed figure
            slowly walked out from the shadows.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a man donned in a peerless white robe, with an exquisite
            ancient sword strapped to his waist. He took leisurely steps amongst
            that piercing Sword-based Daoist Rhyme from the Red Swordsman, not
            affected by it at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Red Swordsman’s pupils narrowed at the sight of Chu Kuangren.
            His sixth sense told him that this Chu Kuangren guy in front of him
            was an undisputed elite!!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>
            Chapter 502: Another Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, Just A
            Game
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren flashed amused looks at the few swordsmen in front of
            him. “Such colorful costumes... People would’ve genuinely thought
            that you guys are cosplaying the Power Rangers.”
          </p>
          <p>Power Rangers?</p>
          <p>What did that mean?</p>
          <p>The Seven-colored Swordsmen were a little confused.</p>
          <p>
            However, they quickly tossed that thought aside and focused their
            gaze onto Chu Kuangren. The Red Swordsman said, “You must be the
            mysterious man that the Zhang clan mentioned. They described a light
            beam that descended from the sky. If I’m not mistaken, you must be a
            sky-pride from the outside world.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Red Swordsman had good knowledge of things. Hence, he was able
            to tell with one look where Chu Kuangren came from.
          </p>
          <p>“Not a bad guess.”</p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, a lot of outside world sky-prides have come here to compete
            for the Emperor’s Throne recently. I wonder which orthodoxy you’re
            from?”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s none of your business.”</p>
          <p>
            “I noticed a sword strapped to your waist, so I reckon you’re a
            swordsman as well. In the Nine Heavens, the orthodoxy that is most
            notable for their swordsmanship skills is the Dugu clan. Are you
            from the Dugu clan?”
          </p>
          <p>“Wrong guess.”</p>
          <p>
            “You’re not from the Dugu clan?” The Red Swordsman furrowed his
            brows, but he stopped dwelling on it after a moment. Regardless, he
            must return with that Divine Emerald Lamp today.
          </p>
          <p>
            He drew out the red longsword that was strapped to his waist and
            commanded, “I don’t care which orthodoxy you’re from, hand out the
            Divine Emerald Lamp, or die!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’d like to see you try.” With his finger, Chu Kuangren signaled
            his opponent to come closer.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ll have a taste of your elite swordsmanship skills then!”</p>
          <p>
            The Red Swordsman stared back at him and immediately launched his
            first strike. As soon as his sword swung out, a red sword ray shot
            out along with a blazing flame!
          </p>
          <p>
            This was one of the Sword Tribe’s very own unique techniques,
            Blazing Flame Sword Art!
          </p>
          <p>
            It was also an Emperor Technique. Only a small portion of Sword
            Tribe’s sky-prides and those above Sage’s level were able to
            cultivate this.
          </p>
          <p>“Palm of Sorrow!”</p>
          <p>
            With a lift of Chu Kuangren’s arm, an overwhelming sense of
            damnation spread outward.
          </p>
          <p>
            He then struck out his palm, and a terrifying strength qi quickly
            engulfed the whole place, smothering that blazing sword qi
            effortlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Red Swordsman’s expression changed when the strength qi hit his
            body. He held his sword and fought it off valiantly, but that
            incredible power was hard to fend off even for a Seven-Step Sage
            Ruler like him. As such, the sheer energy blasted him several
            hundred meters backward, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This power... The ability to manipulate the seven emotions. Don’t
            tell me you’re from the Seven Emotions Sect?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Seven Emotions Sect was a mysterious orthodoxy from the Nine
            Heavens, and they had their camps here on Emperor Road too.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were most well known for their abilities to control people’s
            emotions.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, why don’t you give it another guess?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren smiled gently and then raised his arm once again.
            Immense Buddhist Light transcended, forming a thousand-meter-tall
            ancient Buddha, and Brahmic Chimes resounded from the horizon.
          </p>

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>The stern-looking ancient Buddha slowly struck out its palm.</p>
          <p>“No way!!”</p>
          <p>“How is it possible for one to have such power?!”</p>
          <p>The remaining six swordsmen looked astounded.</p>
          <p>
            They quickly intercepted and came before the Red Swordsman. Six
            longswords rapidly swung out, intertwining to form a giant sword
            net.
          </p>
          <p>In a flash, an explosion occurred!</p>
          <p>
            The collision with the sword qi and Buddhist Light formed a violent
            gust of wind that spread all over the place and destroyed the
            surrounding buildings one by one.
          </p>
          <p>
            This left Wu Clan Head and the others scrambling for their safety!
          </p>
          <p>
            All they saw was the sword net, which was formed by six types of
            sword qi, getting torn apart by that ancient Buddha’s palm.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, this palm landed on the six swordsmen’s bodies. Even
            though each of them only sustained a portion of that power, they
            were still hurled backward with their faces drained pale.
          </p>
          <p>“Buddhist Light... Are you from the Putuo Temple?”</p>
          <p>
            One of the swordsmen muttered with terror. The power that he
            showcased was indeed too horrifying.
          </p>
          <p>
            In just two moves, Chu Kuangren had crushed the Seven-colored
            Swordsmen.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Putuo Temple? Do I look like someone who is a vegetarian and chants
            the mantra?” Chu Kuangren said with an amused smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you’re not from the Dugu clan, Seven Emotions Sect, or Putuo
            Temple, then which freaking Nine Heavens orthodoxy are you from?!”
          </p>
          <p>The Red Swordsmen questioned him in disbelief.</p>
          <p>
            This was a man who not only had several distinct Emperor Techniques
            but had even mastered all those techniques wholly. This was
            incredibly scary.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Such an appalling strength. This guy has got to be an outlawed
            sky-pride!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Yellow Swordsman could not help but exclaim in disbelief as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>“We’re not at his level!”</p>
          <p>“Let’s leave!”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing that things were not going their way, the swordsmen attempted
            to flee. They combined their strengths and released a sword qi each.
            Seven sword qi interweaved in the air, forming a multicolored sword
            qi torrent, and a terrifying power erupted from seven distinctly
            unique Sword-based Daoist Rhymes. This attack was already as mighty
            as a Boundary Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, Chu Kuangren remained composed. He slightly lifted his arm,
            where mysterious runes began to crisscross and form a runic barrier
            in front of him. n0𝚟𝔢𝒍𝓊𝑆𝕓.𝗰0𝓂
          </p>
          <p>
            The runic barrier immediately exploded upon contact with the sword
            qi, causing Wu Clan’s entire ground to crumble inward and form a
            gigantic crater.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren stood in the very middle of the crater with
            runes surrounding him. He appeared unscathed!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Runic energy... Is he one of those fellas from the Runic Lands?”
          </p>
          <p>The Red Swordsman mumbled to himself in shock.</p>
          <p>
            This young man in front of him was indeed too mysterious. The moves
            that he had up his sleeves were so strong yet unfathomable.
          </p>
          <p>“Phew. At least I made it out.”</p>
          <p>The Yellow Swordsman thought to himself.</p>

            They did not all escape in the same direction. In fact, they
            scurried in seven different directions respectively. So even if
            their opponent was a Boundary Emperor, he would not be able to catch
            them all.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is this your only escape plan? Don’t you think you’re a bit too
            foolish?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren looked as though he had read through the swordsmen’s
            mind, and a wicked grin etched on the corner of his lip.
          </p>
          <p>
            An incredibly majestic Sword-based Daoist Rhyme erupted from his
            body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately after, sword qi shot skyward, turning into twelve
            indwelling sword qi pillars that connected the ground to the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was one of the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart’s Daoist
            Transformations, the Nine Heaven Sword Prison!
          </p>
          <p>
            The few swordsmen had noticed this Daoist Transformation too, and
            they were utterly astonished!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Nine Heaven Sword Prison! I can’t believe I’m seeing this. He has
            the same physique as Master Daoist, the Exquisite Nine Orifices
            Sword Heart!!”
          </p>
          <p>“How is that possible?!”</p>
          <p>
            The Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was a Supreme Daoist
            Physique, and there had been very rare instances of it since the
            beginning of time.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, they now had two of these co-existing in the same era!!</p>
          <p>The Seven-colored Swordsmen were at a loss for words.</p>
          <p>
            Somewhere far away, over a billion kilometers out, at a mountaintop
            that looked like a divine sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            A young man abruptly opened his eyes. Purple sword qi flashed across
            both his eyes, and extremely sharp qi emanated.
          </p>
          <p>“Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart!!”</p>
          <p>
            “There’s another Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart! Who is it? Who
            has the same Supreme Daoist Physique as I do?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            An ice-cold murderous intent shot out from the young man’s eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only one could Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart in this world.
          </p>
          <p>Similarly, only one man could stand at the top of this world.</p>
          <p>
            “That direction is... Stone City?! Could this be the same thing that
            the Seven-colored Swordsmen were sent to deal with?!”
          </p>
          <p>The young man mumbled.</p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>At this moment, in the Wu clan.</p>
          <p>
            The Seven-colored Swordsmen were utterly stunned when they saw Chu
            Kuangren displaying the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart. This
            was more shocking to them than his consecutive Emperor Techniques.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren had heard what these swordsmen had said too.</p>
          <p>
            “Oh, they were commenting about my Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword
            Heart. Is there another Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart on
            Emperor Road? That would be quite a coincidence.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said with a smile.</p>
          <p>
            Twelve sword qi pillars locked down onto the whole place as
            petrifying sword qi formed a prison, rendering the Seven-colored
            Swordsmen no chance to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright. I should stop toying with you guys. It’s about time to end
            our little game now.”
          </p>
          <p>Game?!</p>
          <p>
            The crowd could not help but feel goosebumps at Chu Kuangren’s
            words.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, these Seven-colored Swordsmen were all top-notch Sage
            Rulers.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Chapter 503: Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal, A Call From Shang Qingxue
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>“It’s time to put an end to this game.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said nonchalantly. Following that, he raised his arm,
            and sword qi began to manifest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi burst out, and the incredibly sharp purple sword ray
            threatened to tear the void apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Seven-colored Swordsmen widened their eyes at the sight of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This sword qi is too powerful. There’s no way we can fight it!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “He hasn’t even unleashed his full power yet. He has been toying
            with us all this while. It’s like... a game for him?!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword rays flew toward them at dashing speed. In the blink of an
            eye, they hit the Seven-colored Swordsmen’s bodies, and seven puffs
            of blood mists exploded into the air.
          </p>
          <p>The Seven-colored Swordsmen had crestfallen.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren then turned his gaze to the remaining people who came
            with the Seven-colored Swordsmen, such as Zhang Clan Leader and a
            few others.
          </p>
          <p>He looked at them indifferently, as though they were puny ants.</p>
          <p>
            Zhang Clan Leader and the others’ faces suddenly turned extremely
            pale.
          </p>
          <p>“Please... have mercy on us.”</p>
          <p>
            “We won’t dare to do it again. We were forced by the Sword Tribe to
            do all this!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren did not respond. With a lift of his arm, runes began to
            appear and formed several rings, which encircled them within.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was an extremely high-leveled Runic Binding Technique. Once
            tied in it, it would be near impossible to break free from it unless
            they were stronger than Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ll leave these few for you to handle. As for me, I think it’s
            about time I leave. Since we now know that the Sword Tribe’s target
            is the Divine Emerald Lamp, you guys can feel free to let the word
            out that I have snatched the Divine Emerald Lamp away. I trust that
            they won’t trouble you about it any further. After all, dignity is
            still important to a great orthodoxy.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said calmly.</p>
          <p>The Wu clan people exchanged glances with each other.</p>
          <p>
            “Thank you so much, Brother Chu.” Wu Clan Leader made a fist salute
            and thanked him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don’t mention it. I’ve taken your Emperor Weapon anyway, so I’m not
            exactly on the losing side here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He and the Sword Tribe’s Sword Daoist both had the Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart. Seeing that Sword Daoist had sent his people
            here to snatch this treasure without any hesitation, it was obvious
            from the way he did things that he would not let his Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart counterpart, Chu Kuangren, off the hook so
            easily. Moreover, the Race to Emperorship was currently on, so the
            two of them would surely face off in a battle eventually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since that was the case, Chu Kuangren did not mind getting marked,
            or even hunted down, by this adversary of his.
          </p>
          <p>In any case, he got to earn an Emperor Weapon.</p>
          <p>It was a win for him in any way.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren suddenly felt that he had quite the qualities of a
            great businessman.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wu Clan Leader could only manage a bitter smile at that, as he
            struggled to find a rebuttal to his proposal.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914dfd5ed68b00364a4a98",

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            The Divine Emerald Lamp had brought more catastrophe than prosperity
            to them, so they could only hand it over to Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>“If that is all, we wish you a safe journey, Brother Chu.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, hopefully, we’ll cross paths again one day.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren glanced toward the end of the Emperor Road and took a
            stride forward. In the blink of an eye, he vanished from their
            sights.
          </p>
          <p>“Clan Leader, what do we do with these guys?”</p>
          <p>
            A Wu Clan Elder looked at Zhang Clan Leader and his associates and
            asked. These people had been bound by Chu Kuangren’s sword qi, and
            they had no means of resisting. Hence, they laid down on the ground
            like mere mortals. Upon hearing the Wu Clan Elder’s words, they
            hurriedly looked toward Wu Clan Leader. Forgoing all of their egos,
            they immediately begged for mercy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wu Clan Head stared at those few people on the ground and said
            coldly, “These people know of the deal we made with Chu Kuangren. If
            we let them out there and they spread this news, the Sword Tribe
            will surely come back to destroy us. Hence... we shall kill them
            all!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright.” Without hesitating further, the Wu Clan Elder immediately
            killed those people off on the spot.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>“Answer if you hear this. Answer if you hear this...”</p>
          <p>
            On his way, Chu Kuangren kept contacting Black Heaven Sect’s several
            Daoists using his communication compass.
          </p>
          <p>However, none of them responded.</p>
          <p>
            There were only two possibilities to this. Firstly, the distance
            between them was too far apart. Secondly, his call was blocked off
            by some sort of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was just like how Chu Kuangren could not contact the Black Heaven
            Sect from his current location at the Emperor Road because both
            places were situated on two different dimensions.
          </p>
          <p>Two days later.</p>
          <p>
            “Congratulations, Host. You’ve drawn a Legendary-tier Emperor
            Technique, the Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal!
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren obtained an Emperor Technique from the gacha roll while
            he was on a mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emperor Techniques usually did not excite him much as he already had
            tons of Emperor Techniques in his arsenal.
          </p>
          <p>In this year alone, he had drawn over several of them.</p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, the Emperor Technique that he had gotten this time was
            a little different.
          </p>
          <p>It was an Emperor Technique that could be used on souls!</p>
          <p>
            The soul has always been one of the most mysterious domains in the
            cultivation world. Even Emperors would seldom reach far in this
            domain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name of Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal sounded quite wicked, but
            its usage was even more so.
          </p>
          <p>This Emperor Technique could be used to control people!</p>
          <p>
            This would grant him the ability to plant a slave seal within a
            cultivator’s soul, and from thereon, he could assume complete
            control over the cultivator’s life and death!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than this, this slave seal could influence and manipulate the
            victim’s mind, rendering him or her more submissive towards its
            caster’s commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No wonder it’s called a slave seal. Cultivators who are planted
            with this slave seal would become almost like a slave.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren exclaimed in amazement.</p>
          <p>He then claimed and withdrew this Emperor Technique.</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, a low grumble was heard from not far away, and a
            beast was seen lunging in his way.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            This beast’s combat strength was only at an Honorable level, so it
            was no threat to him. With a flicker of his mind, an invisible mind
            power surged out, pressing the beast firmly onto the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Just in time. I can use you to try out my new Soul-Vanquishing
            Slave Seal.”
          </p>
          <p>The edge of Chu Kuangren’s lips raised.</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, that wolf-formed beast growled insecurely opposite him.
            It could see the fierceness and hostility in Chu Kuangren’s eyes.
          </p>
          <p>“Slave seal, bind!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren thrust out a sword finger sign, and a gush of spiritual
            power jetted out from his fingertip, striking at the top of the
            beast’s head. n0𝑣𝓮𝐥𝑢𝓈𝒷.𝒸0𝑀
          </p>
          <p>
            This spiritual power was incredibly mystical. As it plunged deep
            into the beast’s mind, it pierced right through its soul and finally
            transformed into a gold-colored word, ‘slave’!
          </p>
          <p>Moments later.</p>
          <p>
            The bestial instinct in the beast’s eyes gradually disappeared. It
            slouched down tamely by Chu Kuangren’s side and stuck out its tongue
            to lick on his shoes. It was as tame as a little pug.
          </p>
          <p>“The effect of this slave seal is stronger than I imagined.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said as his eyes lit up.</p>
          <p>
            If he could use this Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal well, it would
            surely be a good utility for him in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right when Chu Kuangren was still admiring the Soul-Vanquishing
            Slave Seal’s greatness, the communication compass in his arms
            suddenly vibrated.
          </p>
          <p>“Eh? Someone got back to me?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren injected his spiritual power into the compass, where a
            voice came through.
          </p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, Sect Leader. Can you hear me?”</p>
          <p>It was Shang Qingxue’s voice.</p>
          <p>“I hear you, Qingxue. Where are you currently at?”</p>
          <p>
            “Sect Leader, I don’t know myself too. There’s snow all around me.
            It looks like I’m... underneath a lake?”
          </p>
          <p>“Looks like?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yes. It seems that I’m trapped inside a strange spatial dimension.
            Above me is a body of lake water.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Apart from that, is there anything else that is unique to the place
            you’re in?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Frost-type energy waves. This place is filled with incredibly
            strong Frost-type energy waves. It’s so cold.”
          </p>
          <p>Cold?</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren could not help but frown at that.</p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue had the Deep Freeze Physique, so the fact that she
            felt cold meant that the freezing qi there must be strong.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Qingxue, stay where you are and don’t do anything for now. Take
            care of yourself. I’ll rush to you as fast as I can. We’ll keep in
            touch.”
          </p>
          <p>“Copy.”</p>
          <p>After ending the call, Chu Kuangren pondered deeply.</p>
          <p>
            Underneath a lake, Frost-type energy waves... What kind of place was
            that?

          <p>
            “Let me find a place to settle down first, and then I’ll continue to
            investigate.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, Chu Kuangren scanned the area with his spiritual
            thought. Once he located a fort approximately twenty kilometers out,
            he immediately moved toward that place.

          <h4>
            Chapter 504: Heavenly Pool Mountain, Heavenly Pool Energy, What A
            Scary Guy
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Inside a fort, there was a white-robed young man whose face was
            covered in spiritual light, and his face was not clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, the visible outline of his facial structure was already
            sufficient to mesmerize many.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many cultivators stole glances at him with curiosity seeping through
            their eyes. Some even thought of using their spiritual thought to
            snoop at his cultivation level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet before these people could take a good look at him, they felt
            like their own spiritual thoughts were rebounded by an incredibly
            powerful force. Thus, they did not dare to try again.
          </p>
          <p>This white-robed young man was none other than Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>
            He slowly came to an inn, picked a random seat, and then sat down.
            He signaled the waiter to his table and ordered a jug of wine.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were plenty of people in the inn, and they were all discussing
            the events that were happening in Emperor Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phenomenon that happened on Emperor Mountain was especially
            enthralling for the people. Everyone was debating who would
            eventually obtain that Emperor’s Throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m not sure if you guys have heard. Recently, there have been some
            strange occurrences at Heavenly Pool Mountain. It’s emanating a
            massive amount of Heavenly Pool energy. Rumor has it that a rare
            treasure is about to reveal itself to the world.”
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, one of the cultivators spoke.</p>
          <p>Upon hearing that, the crowd’s interests were piqued.</p>
          <p>
            “Heavenly Pool Mountain, the place that can freeze you to death?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Pfft, you’re only feeling cold because your cultivation base is
            weak. I know a lot of people are eyeing that Heavenly Pool energy.
            This time, with the changes on Heavenly Pool Mountain, many
            orthodoxies will surely send their own teams there to harvest the
            Heavenly Pool energy. A few past ancient orthodoxies have already
            started acting on it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Apparently, plenty of Heavenly Pool ice crystals have surfaced this
            time as well.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I heard that Heavenly Pool ice crystals can be used to slow down
            the process of aging in cultivators. It can also purify spiritual
            power, and it contains a strong Frost-type Daoist Rhyme.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Not far away from them, Chu Kuangren had heard all of those patrons’
            words and felt a slight shudder in his heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heavenly Pool, Frost-type energy waves, could this be the place
            where Shang Qingxue was trapped?
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren could not help but think to himself.</p>
          <p>
            It seemed that he had to make a trip to this Heavenly Pool no matter
            what.
          </p>
          <p>
            After ordering a jug of wine, Chu Kuangren did not stay much longer
            in the inn. He immediately got up and departed from the place.
          </p>
          <p>Heavenly Pool Mountain.</p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914dfd5ed68b00364a4a98",
                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Heavenly Pool Mountain was covered in thick snow all year long, and
            on top of this mountain was a very unique lake. The water in this
            lake was extremely cold, a type of coldness where even
            Honorable-level cultivators would find it hard to endure. Once
            stepping inside, there would automatically be a risk of freezing to
            death here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite all that, the lake was not frozen. Conversely, the lake
            water looked like a huge mirror, reflecting the sunlight from its
            surface.
          </p>
          <p>Thus, earning itself the name of Heavenly Pool!</p>
          <p>
            Besides that, the water inside this Heavenly Pool contained some
            sort of energy that could increase one’s spiritual power
            cultivation. At a certain time, the Heavenly Pool energy would be
            emitted from the Heavenly Pool, forming a tidal. For most
            cultivators, that would definitely be good fortune.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent times, the Heavenly Pool energy had been emitting at
            increased frequencies, and the magnitude of the tidal was far
            greater than any previous occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some great ones deduced that a kind of exquisite treasure must have
            been produced inside this Heavenly Pool.
          </p>
          <p>Such a deduction had excited a large number of cultivators.</p>
          <p>
            In a short period of time, countless cultivators came to the
            Heavenly Pool in search of that treasure.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, before these cultivators could uncover any treasures, the
            Heavenly Pool was cordoned off by several past ancient orthodoxies
            nearby. Some cultivators who were not affiliated to any forces or
            those who come from a lowly background could only remain outside and
            pick up some of the unwanted things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although these orthodoxies’ actions enraged a lot of cultivators,
            none of them had the courage to step out and criticize them in
            public. n0𝐯𝔢𝓵𝐔𝚜𝚋.𝒸0𝗆
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, they were past ancient orthodoxies. What else could a
            group of organization-less wandering cultivators like them say or do
            to affect their decision?
          </p>
          <p>
            They should just count themselves lucky that the orthodoxies allowed
            them to collect those unwanted items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside the Heavenly Pool, cultivators from several past ancient
            orthodoxies gathered. They had combined forces and locked away the
            passage into the mountain. Hence, only some high-leveled
            cultivators, like Honorables or Sages, were allowed to go in there
            to explore. Still, the most core area of the place remained
            off-limits.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren arrived at the place at that moment.</p>
          <p>
            Seeing the guards at the mountain, he took the initiative to
            showcase his own Sage cultivation level, releasing his domineering
            aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cultivators, who stood guard at the mountain, could not help but
            shiver.
          </p>
          <p>
            They had seen plenty of Sages, but none like Chu Kuangren. Just his
            poise alone was enough to make them shudder in fear, and they had
            never experienced anything like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            This person right in front of them was by no means an ordinary Sage.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Master, you may go in now. I just want to gently remind you that
            the core area of Heavenly Pool Mountain, which is the area around
            the Heavenly Pool, is off-limits. It has been sealed by us, the Sima
            clan, and a few other past ancient orthodoxies, namely the Snow
            Spider Tribe, the Snow Lion Tribe, and the Gu clan.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The disciple in charge of guarding the mountain entrance said in a
            serious manner.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren let out a light chuckle. “Got it.”</p>
          <p>
            “This way then.” That disciple got out of the way, allowing Chu
            Kuangren to enter Heavenly Pool Mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amidst all that snow, Chu Kuangren’s figure gradually disappeared
            from sight.
          </p>
          <p>That disciple suddenly felt perturbed by this.</p>
          <p>
            Soon after that, he shook his head. “It’s just another Sage, so
            there’s no cause for concern, I bet.”
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",

            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            He reminded himself that they were a past ancient orthodoxy. What
            trouble could a mere Sage stir up in the face of their whole
            orthodoxy?!
          </p>
          <p>Inside the Heavenly Pool Mountain.</p>
          <p>
            As Chu Kuangren walked on the layers of thick snow, his spiritual
            thoughts spread, covering a whole hundred kilometers radius.
          </p>
          <p>
            Half of Heavenly Mountain Pool’s images flashed within his sights.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this moment, a puff of white mist gushed towards him amongst the
            snow, and there was also a white-dressed lady following behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This lady was seductive-looking and staring at the white puff with a
            fiery gaze.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren activated his Eye of Revelation.</p>
          <p>
            “Zhu Shiba, original form — a Snow Spider, Supreme Honorable Realm
            cultivation...”
          </p>
          <p>
            After taking a glance at that Snow Spider lady, Chu Kuangren did not
            pay her any more heed. Instead, he set his sight on that white puff
            of mist that she was chasing.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that the Heavenly Pool energy?”</p>
          <p>
            With a lift of his arm, an invisible mind power expanded out from
            Chu Kuangren and turned into a huge hand that grabbed the white mist
            in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Who are you? You sure have the guts to steal from me.” That Snow
            Spider lady’s expression changed when she saw him do that, and she
            yelled at Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren did not bat an eye at her. He simply raised his arm
            again and summoned another round of invisible mind power, which
            directly flung this Snow Spider lady off her feet. As such, she was
            plunged back into the snow headfirst.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only after doing that did Chu Kuangren start taking a closer look at
            the Heavenly Pool energy in his hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There is indeed some kind of pure energy wave contained within
            this, and also a Frost-type Daoist Rhyme...”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s mind flickered and initiated the Universal Cauldron
            Physique. He absorbed this cloud of Heavenly Pool energy into his
            body to refine it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The increase in spiritual power that this cloud of Heavenly Pool
            energy alone gave him was already equivalent to what he could get by
            refining an Honorable Supreme’s flesh and blood essences with the
            Glutinous Devouring Technique. It was no wonder this thing was so
            highly sought after. With his spiritual thought senses, he found
            that numerous of such Heavenly Pool energies were scattered around
            this place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Heavenly Pool Mountain’s core area, especially, had countless
            amounts of Heavenly Pool energies.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were even plenty of Heavenly Pool ice crystals there, which
            were a much higher grade than the Heavenly Pool energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, these were not the main purposes of Chu Kuangren’s visit
            here.
          </p>
          <p>“I wonder if Shang Qingxue is inside there?!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren muttered as he looked toward the core area of the
            Heavenly Pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, his spiritual thought sense could not probe deep into the
            Heavenly Pool because there was a barrier there, which barricaded
            off his spiritual thought sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            He lifted his feet and walked deeper into the Heavenly Pool
            Mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for that white-dress lady earlier, she remained plunged in the
            snowy ground. She stayed motionless amongst the snowstorm, still as
            a sculpture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only when Chu Kuangren was a distance away did she painstakingly
            crawl out from the snow.
          </p>
          <p>
            She stared at Chu Kuangren’s departing silhouette as she said with a
            lingering fear, “What a scary guy...”

          <h4>
            Chapter 505: Shang Qingxue’s Condition, Tearing Open The Enchanted
            Boundary With Both Hands
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>Deep inside Heavenly Pool Mountain, inside the Heavenly Pool.</p>
          <p>
            The Heavenly Pool waters were peaceful and still. It looked like a
            mirror as it reflected the image of the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tremendous amounts of frost qi surged inside the Heavenly Pool
            waters. Occasionally, white Heavenly Pool energy would emanate
            outwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the very center of the Heavenly Pool, a giant snow lotus stood
            proudly amongst the snowstorm. Each petal had an incredibly majestic
            Daoist Rhyme swirling within.
          </p>
          <p>On top of this lotus’ seedpod sat a woman dressed in white.</p>
          <p>
            This woman looked at her surroundings with a dazed look, seemingly
            unaware of where she was currently at.
          </p>
          <p>“What is this?”</p>
          <p>
            The woman suddenly realized that white mists were continuously
            emanating from the seedpod of this lotus, which then seeped inside
            her body.
          </p>
          <p>This mist made her feel extremely cold.</p>
          <p>
            “What an astounding coldness. This snow lotus has got to be a rare
            treasure, but I still don’t understand what is going on here??”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just when this woman was about to get out from the snow lotus,
            several figures walked towards her from a distance.
          </p>
          <p>These people looked overjoyed when they saw the snow lotus.</p>
          <p>“The Frosted-Core Snow Lotus!”</p>
          <p>
            “The rumors are true. A peerless treasure like the Frosted-Core Snow
            Lotus really exists!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The group of people scurried to the edge of the Heavenly Pool.
            However, when they saw the woman on top of the snow lotus, their
            expressions suddenly changed.
          </p>
          <p>“Who is she? Why is she up there?”</p>
          <p>“D*mn. Has somebody else beat us to this item?”</p>
          <p>They did not look too delighted at that.</p>
          <p>
            A cold-hearted woman within their group could not stand it anymore.
            She lifted her arm and summoned her spiritual power. A bolt of
            snowy-white spider web, which contained immense spiritual power,
            gushed out.
          </p>
          <p>
            This spider web contained an extremely strong power. As a reflex,
            the woman on the snow lotus put out her hand to defend herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, before she could do so, the snow lotus petal underneath her
            feet vibrated slightly. Frost qi from all over the Heavenly Pool
            swirled and formed an ice wall in front of her, blocking off that
            spider web.
          </p>

            The woman exclaimed in shock, “This snow lotus, it’s protecting
            me?!”

          <p>Noting that, she ditched her plans of leaving.</p>

            That group of people near the lake did not look like kind folks

          <p>
            At the other side of Heavenly Pool, a few of them looked perplexed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Rumor has it that the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus is a conscious being
            and that it will select its own owner. It seems that there is truth

          <p>This guy was a sky-pride of the Snow Lion Tribe.</p>
          <p>
            At this moment, he was staring at the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus with
            desire in his eyes. Yet when he saw the woman on it, his face
            immediately turned gloomy. “Guys, look. The Frosted-Core Snow
            Lotus’s energy keeps on fusing with that woman’s. If this keeps on,
            we won’t have any share of this fortune anymore.”
          </p>
          <p>“We must think of a way to halt this process.”</p>
          <p>“Let’s do it.”</p>
          <p>In a moment, those sky-prides began to launch their attacks.</p>
          <p>
            Various types of powerful energies were unleashed, each having the
            standard of a Sage Ruler level of higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, the snow lotus quivered, and frost qi from the entire
            Heavenly Pool was amassed into a frost qi ice wall, barricading off
            all the incoming energies.
          </p>
          <p>How tough was this Heavenly Pool frost qi?</p>
          <p>
            It was not something these few sky-prides could easily break past.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noticing that she was safe for now, the woman on the snow lotus
            started to investigate what was going on around her.
          </p>
          <p>
            She found that ever since the white mist from the snow lotus seeped
            into her body, it had slowly altered her own physique.
          </p>
          <p>This alteration seemed to be beneficial for her.</p>
          <p>
            “Could this snow lotus upgrade my Deep Freeze Physique to another
            tier?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Deep Freeze Physique. This woman was the person Chu Kuangren had
            been looking for, Shang Qingxue.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finding out that there was a chance for her physique to be
            upgraded to a higher tier, Shang Qingxue felt like she was on cloud
            nine.
          </p>
          <p>
            She sat cross-legged on the snow lotus, actively absorbing the
            energy that was emitted from the snow lotus.
          </p>
          <p>
            “B*tch, you better get your *ss down from the Frosted-Core Snow
            Lotus right now!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The sky pride at the edge of the Heavenly Pool could not resist
            yelling furiously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, Shang Qingxue was not a fool. She knew that going down
            there would not be any good for her, so she did not pay any heed to
            those sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My lady, this Frosted-Core Snow Lotus is of utmost importance to
            us. Please kindly leave It alone. We can promise that we won’t hurt
            you if you oblige. We will even reward you dearly. If you insist on
            not leaving, I assure you that even if you could successfully refine
            this Frosted-Core Snow Lotus, there is no chance you can escape
            captivity from the few great orthodoxies like us.”
          </p>
          <p>Just then, a gentlemanly sky-pride spoke to her.</p>
          <p>
            His words were almost half-luring, but half-threatening. It was far
            smarter than that sky-pride earlier who merely lashed out on her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that, Shang Qingxue remained there, acting like she had not
            heard anything.
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t blame us for doing this then.”</p>
          <p>
            That gentlemanly sky-pride could not hold his act any longer as he,
            too, revealed a ruthless look and declared, “Everyone, continue with
            the attack. I don’t believe we’re not capable of breaking down the
            snow lotus’ defenses.”

          <p>...</p>
          <p>
            Outside the Heavenly Pool, there was a barrier that was set up
            jointly by a few orthodoxies.
          </p>
          <p>
            This barrier was incredibly powerful. Even an elite of the Sage
            Ruler level would find it difficult to breakthrough.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other side of the barrier, some Sages looked toward the
            Heavenly Pool with helpless glances.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Gu clan, Sima clan, Snow Spider Tribe, and Snow Lion Tribe are
            way too unreasonable. That Heavenly Pool by no means belongs to
            them, yet they act like it is their territory. They have kept all
            the good stuff to themselves, leaving only the unwanted junk outside
            for us. How is this fair?” a Sage lamented.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sigh, what can we do? They are way stronger than all of us, so they
            can afford to act this way,” another Sage remarked solemnly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This time, the changes happening in Heavenly Pool are definitely
            pointing toward the emergence of a treasure.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The most mythical item in the Heavenly Pool is none other than the
            Frosted-Core Snow Lotus. Legend has it that this unique treasure
            requires at least a hundred thousand years to produce. It has an
            overwhelming power to alter the course of one’s life. According to
            the legends, there was once a great Emperor whose abilities were
            extremely ordinary, but after he got his hands on the Frosted-Core
            Snow Lotus, his physique experienced an overwhelming transformation.
            It became a crucial turning point in his pursuit of the Emperor’s
            Throne.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sages were engaged in a meaningful discussion, all yearning for
            that treasure that laid within the Heavenly Pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, their ambitions were shattered because of the interference
            of several past ancient orthodoxies.
          </p>
          <p>“Look. Someone is approaching.”</p>
          <p>
            Just then, someone looked a distance away and exclaimed, seemingly
            startled.
          </p>
          <p>It was because that person looked too extraordinary.</p>
          <p>
            It was a white-robed person with black hair, whose face was covered
            in a thin layer of spiritual light. Nobody could see his face
            clearly, but the exposed outline of his face was enough to give away
            that he was no ordinary person.
          </p>
          <p>
            His white robe was speckless, his demeanor elegant and otherworldly.
            He looked like he was one with this snowy landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            That person slowly walked towards the edge of the Heavenly Pool
            amidst all the snowstorm. Then, he stopped right in front of it.
          </p>
          <p>“What is he doing?”</p>
          <p>“Is he a member of one of those orthodoxies?”</p>
          <p>
            “No way. If he is one of them, he could’ve just entered straight
            away. He didn’t need to stop.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowd began to exchange whispers as they watched this scene
            intriguingly.
          </p>
          <p>That person was none other than Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>
            He glanced at the barrier in front of him before he slowly stretched
            out a hand to give it a touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, electric arcs appeared out of nowhere, surging in Chu
            Kuangren’s direction with a deafening screech.
          </p>
          <p>
            These electric arcs had immense power, one that usual Sages would
            not be able to sustain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that, Chu Kuangren allowed those electric arcs to charge
            down on him. He felt a brief numbness, but it was unable to deal any
            damage to his Supreme Sage physique.
          </p>
          <p>The Sages all around him began to gasp in terror.</p>
          <p>This flesh body of his was way too outrageous.</p>
          <p>
            Immediately after, Chu Kuangren made a move that appalled them even
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            They saw him grabbing at that barrier with both his hands, tearing
            it apart to both sides, and allowing those horrifying electric arcs
            to wreak destruction upon his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a loud boom, that barrier that was set up by a few past ancient
            orthodoxies was torn apart by Chu Kuangren’s bare hands and brute
            force. Just like that, he carved out a huge opening on it using
            nothing but his flesh alone!

          <p></p>
          <p>Deep inside Heavenly Pool Mountain, inside the Heavenly Pool.</p>
          <p>
            The Heavenly Pool waters were peaceful and still. It looked like a
            mirror as it reflected the image of the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tremendous amounts of frost qi surged inside the Heavenly Pool
            waters. Occasionally, white Heavenly Pool energy would emanate
            outwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the very center of the Heavenly Pool, a giant snow lotus stood
            proudly amongst the snowstorm. Each petal had an incredibly majestic
            Daoist Rhyme swirling within.
          </p>
          <p>On top of this lotus’ seedpod sat a woman dressed in white.</p>
          <p>
            This woman looked at her surroundings with a dazed look, seemingly
            unaware of where she was currently at.
          </p>
          <p>“What is this?”</p>
          <p>
            The woman suddenly realized that white mists were continuously
            emanating from the seedpod of this lotus, which then seeped inside
            her body.
          </p>
          <p>This mist made her feel extremely cold.</p>
          <p>
            “What an astounding coldness. This snow lotus has got to be a rare
            treasure, but I still don’t understand what is going on here??”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just when this woman was about to get out from the snow lotus,
            several figures walked towards her from a distance.
          </p>
          <p>These people looked overjoyed when they saw the snow lotus.</p>
          <p>“The Frosted-Core Snow Lotus!”</p>
          <p>
            “The rumors are true. A peerless treasure like the Frosted-Core Snow
            Lotus really exists!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The group of people scurried to the edge of the Heavenly Pool.
            However, when they saw the woman on top of the snow lotus, their
            expressions suddenly changed.
          </p>
          <p>“Who is she? Why is she up there?”</p>
          <p>“D*mn. Has somebody else beat us to this item?”</p>
          <p>They did not look too delighted at that.</p>
          <p>
            A cold-hearted woman within their group could not stand it anymore.
            She lifted her arm and summoned her spiritual power. A bolt of
            snowy-white spider web, which contained immense spiritual power,
            gushed out.
          </p>
          <p>
            This spider web contained an extremely strong power. As a reflex,
            the woman on the snow lotus put out her hand to defend herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, before she could do so, the snow lotus petal underneath her
            feet vibrated slightly. Frost qi from all over the Heavenly Pool
            swirled and formed an ice wall in front of her, blocking off that
            spider web.
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman exclaimed in shock, “This snow lotus, it’s protecting
            me?!”
          </p>
          <p>Noting that, she ditched her plans of leaving.</p>
          <p>
            That group of people near the lake did not look like kind folks
            either. If she were to approach them, they would most likely harm
            her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “D*mn. Why is the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus protecting this woman?”

          <p>
            “B*tch, you better get your *ss down from the Frosted-Core Snow
            Lotus right now!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The sky pride at the edge of the Heavenly Pool could not resist
            yelling furiously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, Shang Qingxue was not a fool. She knew that going down
            there would not be any good for her, so she did not pay any heed to
            those sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My lady, this Frosted-Core Snow Lotus is of utmost importance to
            us. Please kindly leave It alone. We can promise that we won’t hurt
            you if you oblige. We will even reward you dearly. If you insist on
            not leaving, I assure you that even if you could successfully refine
            this Frosted-Core Snow Lotus, there is no chance you can escape
            captivity from the few great orthodoxies like us.”
          </p>
          <p>Just then, a gentlemanly sky-pride spoke to her.</p>
          <p>
            His words were almost half-luring, but half-threatening. It was far
            smarter than that sky-pride earlier who merely lashed out on her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that, Shang Qingxue remained there, acting like she had not
            heard anything.
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t blame us for doing this then.”</p>
          <p>
            That gentlemanly sky-pride could not hold his act any longer as he,
            too, revealed a ruthless look and declared, “Everyone, continue with
            the attack. I don’t believe we’re not capable of breaking down the
            snow lotus’ defenses.”

          <p>...</p>
          <p>
            Outside the Heavenly Pool, there was a barrier that was set up
            jointly by a few orthodoxies.
          </p>
          <p>
            This barrier was incredibly powerful. Even an elite of the Sage
            Ruler level would find it difficult to breakthrough.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other side of the barrier, some Sages looked toward the
            Heavenly Pool with helpless glances.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Gu clan, Sima clan, Snow Spider Tribe, and Snow Lion Tribe are
            way too unreasonable. That Heavenly Pool by no means belongs to
            them, yet they act like it is their territory. They have kept all
            the good stuff to themselves, leaving only the unwanted junk outside
            for us. How is this fair?” a Sage lamented.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sigh, what can we do? They are way stronger than all of us, so they
            can afford to act this way,” another Sage remarked solemnly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This time, the changes happening in Heavenly Pool are definitely
            pointing toward the emergence of a treasure.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The most mythical item in the Heavenly Pool is none other than the
            Frosted-Core Snow Lotus. Legend has it that this unique treasure
            requires at least a hundred thousand years to produce. It has an
            overwhelming power to alter the course of one’s life. According to
            the legends, there was once a great Emperor whose abilities were
            extremely ordinary, but after he got his hands on the Frosted-Core
            Snow Lotus, his physique experienced an overwhelming transformation.
            It became a crucial turning point in his pursuit of the Emperor’s
            Throne.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sages were engaged in a meaningful discussion, all yearning for
            that treasure that laid within the Heavenly Pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, their ambitions were shattered because of the interference
            of several past ancient orthodoxies.
          </p>
          <p>“Look. Someone is approaching.”</p>
          <p>
            Just then, someone looked a distance away and exclaimed, seemingly
            startled.
          </p>
          <p>It was because that person looked too extraordinary.</p>
          <p>
            It was a white-robed person with black hair, whose face was covered
            in a thin layer of spiritual light. Nobody could see his face
            clearly, but the exposed outline of his face was enough to give away
            that he was no ordinary person.
          </p>
          <p>
            His white robe was speckless, his demeanor elegant and otherworldly.
            He looked like he was one with this snowy landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            That person slowly walked towards the edge of the Heavenly Pool
            amidst all the snowstorm. Then, he stopped right in front of it.
          </p>
          <p>“What is he doing?”</p>
          <p>“Is he a member of one of those orthodoxies?”</p>
          <p>
            “No way. If he is one of them, he could’ve just entered straight
            away. He didn’t need to stop.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowd began to exchange whispers as they watched this scene
            intriguingly.
          </p>
          <p>That person was none other than Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>
            He glanced at the barrier in front of him before he slowly stretched
            out a hand to give it a touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, electric arcs appeared out of nowhere, surging in Chu
            Kuangren’s direction with a deafening screech.
          </p>
          <p>
            These electric arcs had immense power, one that usual Sages would
            not be able to sustain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that, Chu Kuangren allowed those electric arcs to charge
            down on him. He felt a brief numbness, but it was unable to deal any
            damage to his Supreme Sage physique.
          </p>
          <p>The Sages all around him began to gasp in terror.</p>
          <p>This flesh body of his was way too outrageous.</p>
          <p>
            Immediately after, Chu Kuangren made a move that appalled them even
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            They saw him grabbing at that barrier with both his hands, tearing
            it apart to both sides, and allowing those horrifying electric arcs
            to wreak destruction upon his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a loud boom, that barrier that was set up by a few past ancient
            orthodoxies was torn apart by Chu Kuangren’s bare hands and brute
            force. Just like that, he carved out a huge opening on it using
            nothing but his flesh alone!

            Heaven Sect Disciples, That Person Is Here
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            “So, you guys want to fight against our Wang clan?” Wang Tianteng
            looked at the past ancient orthodoxies’ strongest sky-prides and
            said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Heh, the Wang clan might be powerful, but don’t you forget, we’re
            now in the Emperor Road. Most of your Wang clan’s forces are located
            at the Nine Heavens instead. Besides, in the fight of the Emperor
            Road, who the hell cares about your identity? To put it shortly,
            this Snow Lotus is mine,” Bai Shixin replied with a sneer.
          </p>
          <p>Princess Zhu and Sima Ren both looked at Wang Tianteng coldly.</p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, why don’t you guys show me what the top-notch sky-prides in
            the Emperor Road are capable of.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As a top-notch sky-pride from the Nine Heavens, Wang Tianteng
            naturally would not back down that easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since they refused to back down, the four of them were trapped in a
            four-way deadlock.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their powerful aura spread forth and engulfed most of the Heavenly
            Pool.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Along with the sound of spiritual power slamming into the void, Bai
            Shixin made his attack first.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he unleashed a punch, his terrifying spiritual power formed into
            a white lion phantom that pounced at Wang Tianteng.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside him, both Sima Ren and Princess Zhu made their attack at Wang
            Tianteng as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, they were all native sky-prides of the Emperor Road,
            while Wang Tiantend was an outsider. As such, the three of them felt
            that it was only right to deal with the outsider first.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmph. Great Five Ways Palm!”</p>
          <p>
            Wang Tianteng suddenly yelled as he unleashed a palm attack.
            Five-colored lights radiated in the void as spiritual power erupted,
            forming a gigantic colorful palm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several different energies collided together with a bang, creating
            an explosion that sent terrifying shockwaves everywhere.
            Consequently, the other onlooking sky-prides were blasted away.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What a terrifying strength. I think this is at least the level of a
            Fifth-Step, no, a Seventh-Step Sage Ruler.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s so powerful. He really lives up to the name of the strongest
            beings below the level of an outlaw sky-pride.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the Snow Lotus, Shang Qingxue’s attention was focused on the
            battle as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems that Wang Tianteng is much stronger now than he was on the
            Firmament Star.”
          </p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue mumbled.</p>
          <p>
            However, this progress was normal as it had been a year since then.
            As a top-notch sky-pride, he could not afford to stagnate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four sky-prides were all forced back by the energy collision.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was blood on the corner of Wang Tianteng’s mouth. Despite
            making great improvement over the past year, it still proved to be
            difficult for him to face off against three top-notch sky-prides,
            who were no weaker than him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You’re not a match for the three of us, Wang Tianteng. I suggest
            you leave obediently right now. Otherwise, there’ll be trouble.” Bai
            Shixin laughed coldly. n0𝗏𝑒𝑙𝑢𝐒𝔟.𝕔0𝔪

          <p>“Hmph. You want me to leave? Never!”</p>
          <p>
            Wang Tianteng took out a Boundary Emperor Weapon that resembled a
            bronze bell. It was radiating with colorful sparkles and surging
            with mysterious Daoist Rhymes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a weapon that he had refined for many years and that he most
            preferred, the Primeval Five Ways Bell!
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Primeval Five Ways Bell appeared above Wang Tianteng, rays
            of colorful light enveloped him within. It was like an unbreakable
            barrier.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmph. Let’s see how you block this!”</p>
          <p>
            Bai Shixin let out a low cry as he took out a pair of black gloves
            and put them on.
          </p>
          <p>“Beast Ruler Rage!”</p>
          <p>
            Accompanied by a roar, an incredibly terrifying Daoist Rhyme erupted
            from Bai Shixin’s body. As if he had become the ruler of beasts, he
            unleashed a punch.
          </p>
          <p>
            His white lion phantom roared again as it crashed on the colorful
            barrier formed by the Primeval Five Ways Bell, sending shockwaves
            everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the Heavenly Pool nearby rippled, and large amounts of freezing
            qi billowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the shockwaves dispersed, Wang Tianteng was seen standing
            proudly and unscathed despite taking the full blow of Bai Shixin’s
            attack.
          </p>
          <p>“This bell’s defensive power is strong!”</p>
          <p>Bai Shixin, Princess Zhu, and Sima Ren frowned.</p>
          <p>
            “If we can’t get through that barrier, how are we going to defeat
            that guy?” Princess Zhu uttered.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s no way you guys can ever beat me. How about this? Why don’t
            we split the Snow Lotus instead?” Wang Tianteng suddenly made a
            proposal.
          </p>
          <p>“How are we going to split it?”</p>
          <p>
            “There’s a total of twelve petals on that Snow Lotus. Seeing that
            there are four of us, why don’t we take three petals each? How about
            that?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wang Tianteng knew that with his current strength, it would be
            unrealistic for him to defeat the three past ancient orthodoxy
            sky-prides before him and get that Snow Lotus for himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since that was the case, he might as well take a step back and
            divide the Snow Lotus among them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other three looked at each other and pondered on Wang Tianteng’s
            proposal.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If we don’t come to an agreement soon, the power of that Snow Lotus
            will be completely absorbed by the woman inside it. By the time it
            recognizes her as its master, none of us will have a chance to get
            it.”
          </p>
          <p>Wang Tianteng explained.</p>
          <p>
            “Very well. We shall compromise and divide this Snow Lotus among
            ourselves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. Consider yourself lucky. If it weren’t for that defensive
            weapon of yours, you’d stand no chance at getting even a single leaf
            from that lotus.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Shixin snorted as he shifted his gaze towards Shang Qingxue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, he let out a punch. Its overflowing spiritual power crashed
            onto the barrier that was created by the Heavenly Pool’s freezing
            qi.
          </p>
          <p>The whole Heavenly Pool shook.</p>

          </div>
          <p>
            However, no matter how powerful that attack was, it still could not
            destroy that barrier.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This barrier is indeed formed by the Heavenly Pool’s freezing qi.
            It’s not easy to break through at all. But, woman, do you think you
            can sit in there peacefully forever?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Shixin uttered as he channeled his spiritual power once again.
          </p>
          <p>
            His white lion phantom manifested from his body before it dashed
            towards the freezing qi barrier and slammed into it.
          </p>
          <p>A crack suddenly appeared on the once unbreakable barrier.</p>
          <p>“Let us help you.”</p>
          <p>
            Wang Tianteng, Princess Zhu, and Sima Ren began to attack as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sword qi, Five Ways energy, and blizzard energy landed on the
            freezing qi barrier all at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            As time passed, many more cracks appeared across the entire barrier.
          </p>
          <p>“This is bad.”</p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue’s expression changed.</p>
          <p>
            Under the combined attacks from the four top-notch sky-prides, the
            freezing qi barrier could not hold on any longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The freezing qi barrier shattered with a loud crash. Large amounts
            of energy surged towards Shang Qingxue. She quickly channeled her
            spiritual power and unleashed a sword attack, which turned her ice
            sword qi into a large web that blocked all the incoming shockwaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although she was not injured, her expression was extremely
            unpleasant.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was clear that those were the energy that remained from the
            attacks that ruptured the freezing qi barrier. This did not mean
            that she could fend off Wang Tianteng and the other’s attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            She may have improved a lot throughout the past year, but she was
            only capable of handling one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Against the combined forces of the four sky-prides, she stood no
            chance at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your strength is quite remarkable, woman. However, it’s a shame
            that we’re your opponents.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Not allowing any time for the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus to regenerate
            another freezing qi barrier, Bai Shixin attacked again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lion phantom, which was formed with Daoist Rhyme and spiritual
            power, pounced towards Shang Qingxue. It was so powerful that
            wherever it passed, the void trembled, causing the freezing qi to
            billow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as Shang Qingxue was about to resist with all her strength, a
            cold voice suddenly rang out from afar.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I really am curious to find out who dares to lay their finger on my
            Black Heaven Sect disciple!”
          </p>
          <p>
            That person’s voice made it before the person himself could, and it
            was accompanied by a surge of palm qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The domineering palm qi immediately shattered the lion phantom into
            pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only that, but after destroying the phantom lion, the palm qi
            remained incredibly terrifying and powerful as it headed towards
            Wang Tianteng and the others next!
          </p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            The expressions of those four sky-prides changed. They hurriedly
            channeled their spiritual powers in an attempt to resist that
            attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as if he had noticed something, Wang Tianteng lost his will
            to fight back. Instead, he channeled the power of the Primeval Five
            Ways Bell to the maximum, shielding himself within the incredibly
            radiant five-colored light. Despite it being his most frequently
            used Boundary Emperor Weapon, it gave him no sense of security at
            all.
          </p>
          <p>
            He looked towards the distance with horror and said, “That person is
            here!!”
          </p>

            Boundary Emperor, Retreat
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>“Who dares to hurt my Black Heaven Sect disciple!!”</p>
          <p>
            Along with a proud voice, a surge of palm qi swept in from a
            distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            After shattering the white lion phantom, the palm qi continued
            heading towards Bai Shixin and the others.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four sky-prides could not escape as they were locked on by the
            palm qi attack. All they could do was channel their spiritual power
            to resist that attack instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the power of that palm qi attack was just too terrifying.
            Even with the four of them resisting it together, they were still
            forced back several hundred meters. All of them immediately spewed
            blood as their faces turned pale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only Wang Tianteng, who had used the Primeval Five Ways Bell to fend
            off that attack, seemed slightly better than the others.
          </p>
          <p>
            He looked towards the distance with horror in his eyes. “He’s here.
            That guy is really here!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            As a top-notch sky-pride in the Nine Heavens, other than those
            outlaw sky-prides, Wang Tianteng never feared anyone among the
            younger generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, one year ago, he met someone when he descended into the
            world to fight for the Emperor’s Opportunities of Fortune.
          </p>
          <p>
            That person had never spoken to him before, let alone fought him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that, that person shocked him so much that it left a lasting
            impression on him.
          </p>
          <p>As of now, he could feel the aura of that person once again.</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, a stream of light landed on the surface of the
            Heavenly Pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            That person was dressed in white and had black hair. His handsome
            appearance coupled with his otherworldly demeanor made every
            sky-prides at the scene light up with shock.
          </p>
          <p>“It really is him!” Wang Tianteng gulped and said.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren stood at the surface of the Heavenly Pool’s water, not
            affected by the erosion of the freezing qi coming from all
            directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            He took a look at Shang Qingxue, who was on the Snow Lotus and
            activated his Eye of Revelation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Shang Qingxue, cultivation level – Sage, Deep Freeze Physique
            upgrading in process, overall progress – ninety percent...”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren was amazed.</p>
          <p>
            The Deep Freeze Physique was already a top-tiered Daoist Physique.
            If upgraded, it would become a Supreme Daoist Physique at once.
          </p>
          <p>He could not believe Shang Qingxue would have such luck.</p>
          <p>“Sect Leader!”</p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue was incredibly delighted to see Chu Kuangren, and she
            immediately calmed down.
          </p>
          <p>
            She knew that with that person’s arrival, any troubles would be
            immediately dealt with.
          </p>
          <p>Her admiration towards him was close to blind worship.</p>
          <p>
            In fact, Chu Kuangren was already a symbol of hope and admiration to
            everyone in the Black Heaven Sect.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright. Just focus on upgrading your Daoist Physique and leave the
            rest to me.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said.</p>

          </div>
          <p>
            Then, he looked towards Bai Shixin and the others, to whom he spoke
            in an apathetic tone. “You guys have some guts for trying to injure
            my Black Heaven Sect disciple.”
          </p>
          <p>“Black Heaven Sect? Which orthodoxy is that?!”</p>
          <p>
            “Never heard of it before. It must be some orthodoxy from the
            outside world.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m more or less aware of the forces in the Nine Heavens, but this
            is still the first time I’ve heard of Black Heaven Sect too.”
          </p>
          <p>Bai Shixin and others were slightly confused.</p>
          <p>
            Since they had not heard of the Black Heaven Sect before, it meant
            that it was not a past ancient or archaic ancient orthodoxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren’s combat strength was just too terrifying.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one knew how much strength he had used in the attack to injure
            three top-notched sky-prides with a single move.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, if you want this Frosted-Core Snow Lotus, I will let
            you have it.”
          </p>
          <p>Wang Tianteng’s words were a huge shock to everyone else.</p>
          <p>
            They could not believe that a top-notch sky-pride would not dare to
            fight Chu Kuangren for that item.
          </p>
          <p>“What did you just say? Let me have it?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren laughed and replied in a cold tone. “Let me have it,
            huh? Do you think I need your permission if I want to have it?”
          </p>
          <p>Wang Tianteng’s face immediately turned pale.</p>
          <p>He suddenly felt that he had said something stupid.</p>
          <p>
            “I don’t care who you are. This area has been sealed off by our
            orthodoxies, so hand over the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus and leave this
            place.”
          </p>
          <p>Bai Shixin said after consuming a medicinal pill.</p>
          <p>
            Although Chu Kuangren was shockingly powerful, the Heavenly Pool was
            now surrounded by several of the past ancient orthodoxies’ strongest
            cultivators. There were even some Boundary Emperors at the scene as
            well. Bai Shixin believed that even an outlaw sky-pride would not be
            able to exit that area peacefully with the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re too noisy, little kitty.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said before pointing his finger toward Bai Shixin.</p>
          <p>A surge of finger strength erupted.</p>
          <p>
            Bai Shixin was appalled. He felt as if some terrifying power had
            locked onto him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before he could react, his mind wavered and lost consciousness for a
            second.
          </p>
          <p>After that, his head violently exploded like a watermelon.</p>
          <p>Red and white matter were splattered all over the place.</p>
          <p>
            As the ones closest to him, Princess Zhu and Sima Ren did not manage
            to dodge the blood that had splattered all over them.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were stunned in their place, trembling. There was a look of
            horror in their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>It was very horrifying.</p>
          <p>
            Just like that, a top-notch sky-pride was brutally killed off before
            their very eyes. They had no time to react to what was happening at
            all.
          </p>
          <p>That kind of power was truly terrifying!</p>
          <p>“Shixin!”</p>

          </div>
          <p>A roar rang out from the distance.</p>
          <p>
            A figure rushed over, looking at the headless corpse on the ground
            with rage.
          </p>
          <p>
            That person was Bai Lei, the Boundary Emperor that Chu Kuangren
            casually defeated earlier.
          </p>
          <p>“You bast*rd!!”</p>
          <p>“Aren’t you guys going to do something?”</p>
          <p>
            Only when Bai Lei roared did several figures appear before them.
          </p>
          <p>
            These figures emanated an incredibly powerful aura. They were the
            Boundary Emperors sent forth by the past ancient orthodoxies to
            scout the Heavenly Pool.
          </p>
          <p>The few of them looked at Chu Kuangren with caution and fear.</p>
          <p>“The person before us will not be defeated that easily.”</p>
          <p>
            “That’s right. His combat strength is no weaker than a Boundary
            Emperor. I can’t believe the outside world has such a terrifying
            sky-pride!”
          </p>
          <p>“This person is definitely an outlaw sky-pride!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren observed the few people before him and said, “After
            defeating the little ones, here come the older guys. So that’s how
            you do things even in the past ancient orthodoxies, huh? You’re just
            bullying me because I’m a nobody.”
          </p>
          <p>“Boy, what the hell do you want?”</p>
          <p>
            The few Boundary Emperors did not dare to attack hastily.

          </p>
          <p>
            “Are we going to fight, or not? If not, I suggest you turn around
            and f*ck off.”
          </p>
          <p>“You... bast*rd!”</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Spider Tribe’s Boundary Emperor’s expression turned grim.
            Without another word, she unleashed an attack. “Boundless Snaring
            Web!”
          </p>
          <p>
            She struck out a palm attack, turning spider silk into a huge web
            that headed towards Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>“What a disappointing level of strength.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren remarked. Then, with a clang, the Descendant Self Sword
            on his waist unsheathed half its body, revealing its sword ray.
          </p>
          <p>An immeasurably sharp sword ray shot out!</p>
          <p>
            That giant spider web was immediately cut in half by the sword ray.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, that was not all as the sword ray continued to head towards
            the Snow Spider Boundary Emperor without fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as a tearing sound was heard, a mist of blood gushed out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Boundary Emperor was brutally sliced into two by the sword ray,
            like it was a piece of paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone at the scene was stunned at that display of power, and a
            chill ran down their spines.
          </p>
          <p>
            “A single, no, it is possible that the Boundary Emperor was killed
            in half a strike. By the heavens, what kind of monstrous strength is
            this?”
          </p>
          <p>“Who the hell is this person?”</p>
          <p>“How can there be such a terrifying sky-pride in this world!!”</p>
          <p>
            The remaining three Boundary Emperors were so scared that they took
            two steps back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wang Tianteng got even more terrified. “This guy’s strength has
            become even more unpredictable and unfathomable in just a year.”
          </p>
          <p>“Retreat!!”</p>
          <p>
            Bai Lei gulped, no longer bothered to take revenge as he turned and
            left the area with his men.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the face of Chu Kuangren’s horrifying combat strength that could
            kill a Boundary Emperor in a second, all their intentions to fight
            him were gone.

          </p>
          <p>“Let’s leave!”</p>
          <p>Wang Tianteng and the others decided to leave.</p>
          <p>
            That was when an inexplicable chill suddenly engulfed him and made
            him shudder.
          </p>
          <p>
            “All of you can leave, but the ones that attacked my Black Heaven
            Sect disciple must stay.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment Chu Kuangren said that, Wang Tianteng instantly turned
            into a ray of light and darted towards the distance.
          </p>
          <p>He wanted to flee.</p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren raised his hand and unleashed an invisible
            surge of mind power in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wang Tianteng may be fast, but how could he compare to the speed of
            Chu Kuangren’s mind power?
          </p>
          <p>
            All it took was an instant to trap Wang Tianteng’s figure in
            mid-air, and he could not break free no matter how much spiritual

            “Stop. That person is a sky-pride of the Wang clan, who is an
            archaic orthodoxy. If you dare kill him...”
          </p>
          <p>
            Gu clan’s Boundary Emperor yelled. As the Wang clan’s vassal, the Gu
            clan’s Boundary Emperor could no longer watch on.
          </p>
          <p>Bam!</p>
          <p>Wang Tianteng’s body exploded into a bloody mist in the air.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren tilted his head as he looked at the Gu clan’s Boundary
            Emperor. “You were saying? If I dare kill him, will something
            happen??”
          </p>
          <p>“Y-you...”</p>
          <p>
            The Gu clan’s Boundary Emperor looked at Chu Kuangren. He was so
            enraged that he could not utter a full sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Me? What is it? You can’t even speak clearly for heaven’s sake, and
            you call yourself a Boundary Emperor?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren snickered. Then, he looked at Princess Zhu and Sima
            Ren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of them immediately turned pale with fear upon noticing his
            glare. They immediately ran and hid behind the Boundary Emperors of
            their respective orthodoxy.
          </p>
          <p>It was a clear sign that they were terrified of Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>
            “Fellow Daoist brother, my Snow Spider Tribe is willing to give you
            one hundred and fifty kilograms of soul emblem to spare Princess

          </p>
          <p>“My Sima clan offers the same as well.”</p>
          <p>

          <p>
            Half a kilogram of soul emblem was worth as much as fifty million
            kilograms of top-tier soulstones.
          </p>
          <p>Boom, boom!</p>
          <p>
            However, as soon as the two Boundary Emperors finished speaking,
            several runic swords suddenly appeared beside Princess Zhu and Sima
            Ren.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a blink of an eye, the runic swords surged forth and instantly
            engulfed both Princess Zhu and Sima Ren in an explosion of runic
            energy.
          </p>
          <p>“Princess Zhu!”</p>
          <p>“Sima Ren!!”</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Spider Tribe’s and Sima clan’s Boundary Emperors’
            expressions changed drastically.
          </p>
          <p>
            A top-notch sky-pride was an extremely valuable resource for any
            orthodoxy. Yet just like that, these several orthodoxies’ sky-prides
            had been killed off in succession.
          </p>
          <p>It pained the Boundary Emperors very much.</p>
          <p>
            All of them stared daggers at Chu Kuangren. If eyes could kill, they
            would have ripped Chu Kuangren to shreds.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s leave!”</p>
          <p>
            The Boundary Emperors gritted their teeth and left the area with the
            remaining people.
          </p>
          <p>
            They did not dare to go against Chu Kuangren any further. If they
            did, there was a chance that more sky-prides would die as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was especially true for the Snow Spider Tribe, who had lost a
            Boundary Emperor and top-notch sky-pride today. They could no longer
            afford to suffer anymore.
          </p>
          <p>“Just you wait, human! We won’t let this go so easily!”</p>
          <p>The Boundary Emperors cursed secretly as they left.</p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>
            When everyone had left, Chu Kuangren looked at Shang Qingxue inside
            the Snow Lotus and activated his Eye of Revelation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Deep Freeze Physique upgrade in progress, overall completion –
            ninety-four percent...”
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, now tell me how you got here,” Chu Kuangren asked.</p>
          <p>
            “I’m not sure myself as well. After entering the Emperor Road, I was
            transported by a surge of mysterious spatial energy to an empty
            space under this Heavenly Pool. A few moments after communicating
            with you, I fainted, and when I woke up, I realized that I was on
            top of the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus...” Shang Qingxue told him
            everything that had happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was amazed to hear her story. “It seems that luck is on
            your side to be transported into the Heavenly Pool, and the
            Frosted-Core Snow Lotus just happened to appear. Since your Daoist
            Physique’s attribute fits very well with the Frosted-Core Snow
            Lotus, you caused a reaction that enabled it to recognize you by
            default and allow you to obtain this fortunate opportunity.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He had heard a few rumors about the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it were someone else who obtained it, he might step in and snatch
            it for himself. However, since Shang Qingxue was the one who got it,
            he felt happy for her.
          </p>
          <p>After all, they were all part of the same family.</p>
          <p>
            There was still some time left before the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus
            fully assimilated with Shang Qingxue, which triggered an upgrade of
            her Deep Freeze Physique. Hence, Chu Kuangren did not mind waiting a
            little while longer.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, when the cultivators from the Snow Spider Tribe and Snow
            Lion Tribe left the area, that barrier they had set up disappeared
            as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Heavenly Pool was once again exposed before the likes of
            everyone nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people rushed to the Heavenly Pool, seeking to obtain valuable
            treasures there.

          <p>The energy and ice crystal of the Heavenly Pool...</p>
          <p>Those were extremely valuable to most cultivators.</p>
          <p>
            However, everyone knew that the true treasure laid within the
            Heavenly Pool itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The mysterious occurrence at the Heavenly Pool Mountain must be
            caused by something at the Heavenly Pool itself. That’s where the
            real Opportunities of Fortune will be.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “However, a few great orthodoxies have suddenly left that area for
            some reason. Could they have obtained the Opportunities of Fortune
            within the Heavenly Pool?”
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go there and try our luck.”</p>
          <p>
            Regardless, some of them still came to the Heavenly Pool, seeking to
            try their luck and find out whether they could obtain any leftover
            valuables.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as they arrived at the Heavenly Pool, they saw the giant
            Frosted-Core Snow Lotus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, the Snow Lotus leaves were still closed, as if it was
            an unopened flower bud.
          </p>
          <p>“The Frosted-Core Snow Lotus!”</p>
          <p>
            “I can’t believe a Frosted-Core Snow Lotus has shown up here. But
            why did those people take it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It doesn’t matter. Since it’s in front of us now, we might as well
            take it.”
          </p>
          <p>The group of men delightfully rushed towards the Snow Lotus.</p>
          <p>
            However, a razor-sharp streak of sword qi suddenly slashed across
            the space, leaving a huge mark on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Sage, who was closest to the sword slash mark, was so scared that
            a cold sweat began to form on his forehead.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he had taken another step, that sword qi would have slashed him
            into two!
          </p>
          <p>“Whoever passes this line, dies!”</p>
          <p>An apathetic voice echoed from nearby.</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked towards a large bounder beside the Heavenly Pool,
            only to see a young man in white robes sitting with his back facing
            towards them. His black hair swayed with the wind, giving off an
            otherworldly presence to him.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re just bluffing.”</p>
          <p>
            The Sage took a look at the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus and could no
            longer hold back his desire for it. With a snort, he listed his
            foot, attempting to cross the line marked by Chu Kuangren’s slash.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment his right foot crossed the line, a streak of sword qi
            erupted from the mark before he could even move his left foot.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a tearing sound, that streak of sword qi brutally slashed that
            person apart into two before the eye of everyone at the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s always a fool who wants to test me. So, are the rest of you
            fools like him as well?” n0𝓋𝗲𝓁𝑢𝑠𝓑.𝓒0𝓂
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren’s voice resounded in everyone’s ears once again.</p>
          <p>At that moment, no one doubted his words anymore.</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at the sword mark on the ground as if they were
            looking at the line between life and death. Hence, they hurriedly
            took a few steps back, no longer daring to cross it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This young man seems like that guy who barged into the Heavenly
            Pool earlier. By the looks of it, he’s the reason that the few great
            orthodoxies did not take the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus with them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That must be the case. However, where the hell is this person from?
            To think that he can force the great past ancient orthodoxies to
            compromise for him?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at the figure sitting beside the Heavenly Pool with
            admiration and fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person who could force a few past ancient orthodoxies to
            compromise was undoubtedly not someone they could or should mess
            with.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, the Snow Lotus in the middle of the Heavenly Pool
            suddenly trembled before its twelve petals slowly opened.

            Half a kilogram of soul emblem was worth as much as fifty million
            kilograms of top-tier soulstones.
          </p>
          <p>Boom, boom!</p>
          <p>
            However, as soon as the two Boundary Emperors finished speaking,
            several runic swords suddenly appeared beside Princess Zhu and Sima
            Ren.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a blink of an eye, the runic swords surged forth and instantly
            engulfed both Princess Zhu and Sima Ren in an explosion of runic
            energy.
          </p>
          <p>“Princess Zhu!”</p>
          <p>“Sima Ren!!”</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Spider Tribe’s and Sima clan’s Boundary Emperors’
            expressions changed drastically.
          </p>
          <p>
            A top-notch sky-pride was an extremely valuable resource for any
            orthodoxy. Yet just like that, these several orthodoxies’ sky-prides
            had been killed off in succession.
          </p>
          <p>It pained the Boundary Emperors very much.</p>
          <p>
            All of them stared daggers at Chu Kuangren. If eyes could kill, they
            would have ripped Chu Kuangren to shreds.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s leave!”</p>
          <p>
            The Boundary Emperors gritted their teeth and left the area with the
            remaining people.
          </p>
          <p>
            They did not dare to go against Chu Kuangren any further. If they
            did, there was a chance that more sky-prides would die as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was especially true for the Snow Spider Tribe, who had lost a
            Boundary Emperor and top-notch sky-pride today. They could no longer
            afford to suffer anymore.
          </p>
          <p>“Just you wait, human! We won’t let this go so easily!”</p>
          <p>The Boundary Emperors cursed secretly as they left.</p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>
            When everyone had left, Chu Kuangren looked at Shang Qingxue inside
            the Snow Lotus and activated his Eye of Revelation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Deep Freeze Physique upgrade in progress, overall completion –
            ninety-four percent...”
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, now tell me how you got here,” Chu Kuangren asked.</p>
          <p>
            “I’m not sure myself as well. After entering the Emperor Road, I was
            transported by a surge of mysterious spatial energy to an empty
            space under this Heavenly Pool. A few moments after communicating
            with you, I fainted, and when I woke up, I realized that I was on
            top of the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus...” Shang Qingxue told him
            everything that had happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was amazed to hear her story. “It seems that luck is on
            your side to be transported into the Heavenly Pool, and the
            Frosted-Core Snow Lotus just happened to appear. Since your Daoist
            Physique’s attribute fits very well with the Frosted-Core Snow
            Lotus, you caused a reaction that enabled it to recognize you by
            default and allow you to obtain this fortunate opportunity.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He had heard a few rumors about the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it were someone else who obtained it, he might step in and snatch
            it for himself. However, since Shang Qingxue was the one who got it,
            he felt happy for her.
          </p>
          <p>After all, they were all part of the same family.</p>
          <p>
            There was still some time left before the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus
            fully assimilated with Shang Qingxue, which triggered an upgrade of
            her Deep Freeze Physique. Hence, Chu Kuangren did not mind waiting a
            little while longer.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, when the cultivators from the Snow Spider Tribe and Snow
            Lion Tribe left the area, that barrier they had set up disappeared
            as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Heavenly Pool was once again exposed before the likes of
            everyone nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people rushed to the Heavenly Pool, seeking to obtain valuable
            treasures there.
          </p>

          <p>The energy and ice crystal of the Heavenly Pool...</p>
          <p>Those were extremely valuable to most cultivators.</p>
          <p>
            However, everyone knew that the true treasure laid within the
            Heavenly Pool itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The mysterious occurrence at the Heavenly Pool Mountain must be
            caused by something at the Heavenly Pool itself. That’s where the
            real Opportunities of Fortune will be.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “However, a few great orthodoxies have suddenly left that area for
            some reason. Could they have obtained the Opportunities of Fortune
            within the Heavenly Pool?”
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go there and try our luck.”</p>
          <p>
            Regardless, some of them still came to the Heavenly Pool, seeking to
            try their luck and find out whether they could obtain any leftover
            valuables.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as they arrived at the Heavenly Pool, they saw the giant
            Frosted-Core Snow Lotus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, the Snow Lotus leaves were still closed, as if it was
            an unopened flower bud.
          </p>
          <p>“The Frosted-Core Snow Lotus!”</p>
          <p>
            “I can’t believe a Frosted-Core Snow Lotus has shown up here. But
            why did those people take it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It doesn’t matter. Since it’s in front of us now, we might as well
            take it.”
          </p>
          <p>The group of men delightfully rushed towards the Snow Lotus.</p>
          <p>
            However, a razor-sharp streak of sword qi suddenly slashed across
            the space, leaving a huge mark on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Sage, who was closest to the sword slash mark, was so scared that
            a cold sweat began to form on his forehead.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he had taken another step, that sword qi would have slashed him
            into two!
          </p>
          <p>“Whoever passes this line, dies!”</p>
          <p>An apathetic voice echoed from nearby.</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked towards a large bounder beside the Heavenly Pool,
            only to see a young man in white robes sitting with his back facing
            towards them. His black hair swayed with the wind, giving off an
            otherworldly presence to him.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re just bluffing.”</p>
          <p>
            The Sage took a look at the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus and could no
            longer hold back his desire for it. With a snort, he listed his
            foot, attempting to cross the line marked by Chu Kuangren’s slash.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment his right foot crossed the line, a streak of sword qi
            erupted from the mark before he could even move his left foot.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a tearing sound, that streak of sword qi brutally slashed that
            person apart into two before the eye of everyone at the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s always a fool who wants to test me. So, are the rest of you
            fools like him as well?” n0𝓋𝗲𝓁𝑢𝑠𝓑.𝓒0𝓂
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren’s voice resounded in everyone’s ears once again.</p>
          <p>At that moment, no one doubted his words anymore.</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at the sword mark on the ground as if they were
            looking at the line between life and death. Hence, they hurriedly
            took a few steps back, no longer daring to cross it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This young man seems like that guy who barged into the Heavenly
            Pool earlier. By the looks of it, he’s the reason that the few great
            orthodoxies did not take the Frosted-Core Snow Lotus with them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That must be the case. However, where the hell is this person from?
            To think that he can force the great past ancient orthodoxies to
            compromise for him?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at the figure sitting beside the Heavenly Pool with
            admiration and fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person who could force a few past ancient orthodoxies to
            compromise was undoubtedly not someone they could or should mess
            with.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, the Snow Lotus in the middle of the Heavenly Pool
            suddenly trembled before its twelve petals slowly opened.

            Chapter 511: Overpowering A Boundary Emperor With Ease, Crawl For Me
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            “To hell with his Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart! The only
            outcome for offending our orthodoxies is death.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Snow Lion Tribe Leader grunted and released a torrent of
            Boundary Emperor’s Aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            From his spiritual energy, the apparition of a white lion manifested
            and charged rampantly at Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>“Beast Ruler Rage!”</p>
          <p>
            It was an Emperor Technique practiced by the Snow Lion Tribe.
            However, the Snow Lion Tribe Leader’s display of the technique was
            far more powerful than Bai Shixin’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even as a Boundary Emperor, you’re still practicing another
            person’s Emperor Technique. Where’s your own Dao?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was unfazed. Lifting his hands, he concentrated the
            surrounding natural spiritual energy into his hands before
            unleashing it towards the white lion with a finger technique.
          </p>
          <p>It was the Emperor Technique, Heart Piercing Finger!</p>
          <p>
            A merciless finger technique that would put one’s Daoist core to the
            test!
          </p>
          <p>
            The Snow Lion Tribe Leader felt his spirit freezing over as the
            power of the enormous white lion apparition faded significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he eventually recovered, Chu Kuangren’s Heart Piercing Finger
            was just inches away from him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Snow Lion Tribe Leader roared furiously, heightening the
            strength of his physique as he unleashed a wave of terrifying
            ferocious qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment he struck out his first, it landed on the incoming finger
            qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the relentless finger qi had still managed to blast him
            dozens of meters away. The Snow Lion Tribe Leader felt his arm
            shaking as it bled profusely. His bones felt like they were broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I didn’t think a measly finger technique would inflict such a level
            of damage to my body.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Snow Lion Tribe Leader possessed a rigid Boundary Emperor
            Physique that had been specifically refined before. This physique
            alone should be enough for him to go head-to-head against other
            Boundary Emperors.
          </p>
          <p>
            “His combat strength is impeccable. We won’t stand a chance if we
            fight him alone. Let’s attack together.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sima Clan Leader said. Before he came, the Sima Clan Leader was
            confident that this battle was in the bag. However, it seemed like
            Chu Kuangren had exceeded his expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who would have thought that a young sky-pride was capable of
            overpowering a Boundary Emperor with such ease?
          </p>
          <p>“Attack!”</p>
          <p>The Gu Clan Leader made his move.</p>
          <p>
            The Gu Clan Leader launched his spear into the air like a shooting
            star, and its unforgiving spear ray locked onto Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            On another side, the Snow Spider Tribe Leader leaped several meters
            backward and began spinning her silks rapidly into a large web.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as the spear ray was about to reach Chu Kuangren, he retaliated
            with the Self Descendant Sword.
          </p>

            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            As the sword and the spear interlocked with a deafening explosion, a
            boundless strength qi containing two distinct Daoist Rhymes
            exploded.
          </p>
          <p>
            The icy surface of the Heavenly Pool ruptured into a blizzard of
            snowflakes that swiped violently across the region in a hundred
            kilometers radius.
          </p>
          <p>
            The battle had caused avalanches on the Heavenly Pool Mountain,
            which had been amassing snow all year round.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that all your spear can do?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren swung his Self Descendant Sword, unleashing an even
            domineering sword qi from his blade.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the Gu Clan Leader could feel was the incredibly sharp surge of
            energy coming for him.
          </p>
          <p>“This isn’t good. Get back!”</p>
          <p>Petrified, the Gu Clan Leader hastily retreated.</p>
          <p>
            He retreated just enough for the ray of sword qi to glide past his
            shoulder and landed on a ten thousand-kilometer tall mountain in the
            distance.
          </p>
          <p>The snowy mountain was cleanly sliced into two parts!</p>
          <p>
            The snowstorm seemed to have halted in the areas which the sword qi
            had passed by.
          </p>
          <p>
            Momentarily, the sky seemed clear in Heavenly Pool Mountain, which
            was notorious for its incessant snowstorms.
          </p>
          <p>“Boundless Snaring Web!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, the Snow Spider Tribe Leader had finished spinning
            her web and cast it over Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>The enormous web ensnared all of him on the spot.</p>
          <p>“Break apart!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren lightly grunted and projected a streak of sword qi
            above him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the sword qi landed on the web, it abruptly exploded into
            billions of sword qi that tore the entire enormous web apart.
          </p>
          <p>“Didn’t you want to witness my Dao?”</p>
          <p>“Then, I shall let you experience it for yourself!”</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Lion Tribe Leader charged furiously at Chu Kuangren with a
            violent aura radiating from his body. The blood essence of his body
            boiled as he exhumed a breath of scorching air, instantly
            evaporating the snowflakes that fell around him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of resembling a snow lion, the Snow Lion Tribe Leader was
            now more like a raging fiery lion.
          </p>
          <p>
            With each leap he took, the Heavenly Pool Mountain shook under his
            feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Snow Lion Tribe Leader took precisely seven steps, and the
            mountain shook in seven successions. In seven steps, he covered
            several kilometers in distance and arrived before Chu Kuangren,

          <p>“Seven Steps Fatal Blow!”</p>
          <p>
            The fist technique ruptured the air and caused the void to crack,
            revealing the white crevices within the fabric of space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Chu Kuangren was unmoved. He stood his ground and retaliated
            with another fist technique!

          <p>
            Chu Kuangren did not mobilize even an ounce of spiritual energy in
            his technique. Instead, it was an attack that solely relied on the
            bodily strength of his Supreme Sage Physique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two fists of opposing sizes clashed and caused a terrifying typhoon
            to ensue, devastating everything in the vicinity. The Sages, who
            were observing from afar, sensed the incoming danger and quickly
            mobilized their spiritual energies to defend themselves. All of them
            gasped in shock.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the region where Chu Kuangren clashed with the Snow Lion
            Tribe Leader crumbled into the ground, causing a gigantic fissure to
            form in the middle of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.
          </p>
          <p>“How did that b*stard’s body get so...”</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Lion Tribe Leader stared at Chu Kuangren in utmost
            disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>
            He could sense that Chu Kuangren was solely relying on his bodily
            strength and had not used any spiritual energy at all.
          </p>
          <p>However, how could a Sage Physique be so terrifying?!</p>
          <p>“Was that your Dao?”</p>
          <p>“It’s mediocre at most!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren muttered all of a sudden. Then, he unleashed an
            abundance of energy from his seemingly dainty figure.
          </p>
          <p>“Destroy!”</p>
          <p>
            This time, Chu Kuangren was no longer solely relying on his Supreme
            Sage Physique’s bodily strength. He had also infused his attack with
            a burst of Supreme Sage’s spiritual energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terrifying energy unfurled like a gushing torrent. In an
            instant, it penetrated through the Snow Lion Tribe Leader and tore
            his arms apart.
          </p>
          <p>The remaining attack struck directly on his chest.</p>
          <p>
            With a loud explosion, the Snow Lion Tribe Leader was frothing blood
            around his lips. The attack had caused a deep dent in his chest and
            ruptured countless bones within. Like a cannonball, the Snow Lion
            Tribe Leader was propelled away before crashing onto the ground.
            Just one move was enough to heavily injure him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “D*mn it!” The Snow Lion Tribe Leader was pressing his palms into
            the ground in an attempt to support his body. He still intended to
            continue the battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, a faint yellow rune appeared above him at that
            moment. The rune manifested into the apparition of an enormous
            mountain that crashed down onto the Snow Lion Tribe Leader.
          </p>
          <p>It was a Mountain Rune!</p>
          <p>
            The rune was forged out of the mountain’s natural earth qi. It bore
            a striking resemblance to a technique Chu Kuangren once used — the
            Human Mountain Stamp.
          </p>
          <p>One was a technique, another was a rune.</p>
          <p>
            “Curse you!” The Snow Lion Tribe Leader was incensed. If he was at
            his peak, he might still stand a chance in overcoming the attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren’s heavy punch had left the Snow Lion Tribe
            Leader so weak that it was tremendously difficult for the latter to
            defeat the runic attack.
          </p>
          <p>“Be a good kitty now, and stay down.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren taunted casually. The Snow Lion Tribe Leader was now
            compared to a harmless kitten.
          </p>
          <p>Needless to say, it infuriated him.</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Spider Tribe Leader and Gu Clan Leader were feeling uneasy
            now.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was evident to them that Chu Kuangren’s combat strength had far
            surpassed their imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            “How did the outside world manage to birth such a remarkable
            sky-pride?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Not even the outlawed sky-prides are as overpowered as him! This is
            terrifying!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just then, a surge of boundless Emperor’s Aura unfolded up in the
            sky!

          <h4>
            Chapter 512: Taming An Emperor Weapon, Consecutively Defeating
            Boundary Emperors
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Up in the air, the Sima Clan Leader suddenly drew a golden
            longsword.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blade was embedded with lines of runic scriptures and emitted a
            magnificent oppressive presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the Emperor’s Aura. That’s an Emperor Weapon.” Chu Kuangren
            squinted his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Little brat, it’s about time I show you the power of the Sima
            clan’s Emperor Weapon!” the Sima Clan Leader announced loudly. With
            the abrupt swing of his blade, he unleashed a streak of golden sword
            qi that shot downwards on Chu Kuangren like a golden dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi shattered parts of the realms, leaving traces of white
            crevices in its path.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You speak as if I don’t own one myself,” Chu Kuangren said
            indifferently before he lifted his hand and summoned a golden
            halberd.
          </p>
          <p>It was none other than the Empyrean Neptune’s Trident Halberd.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren swung his halberd and unleashed the earth-shattering
            force of the ferocious ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            The golden sword ray and the majestic torrential force collided
            violently.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clash of the Emperor Weapons’ power created an impact as strong
            as one hundred thousand mountains colliding into one. Its
            frightening aftermath shattered almost half of Heavenly Pool
            Mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having been forced to retreat several dozens of kilometers due to
            the blast wave, the observing Sages stared at the Heavenly Pool
            Mountain in horror.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Such energy can only be the result of the crossing of two Emperor
            Weapons. Oh dear, that b*stard has an Emperor Weapon of his own!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Neither the past ancient nor even archaic ancient orthodoxies
            possess many Emperor Weapons. Yet, that b*stard’s carrying an
            Emperor Weapon of his own! How rich must his orthodoxy be for their
            sky-pride to be carrying an Emperor Weapon around?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The clash of the Emperor Weapons is too powerful. Let’s not get too
            near.”
          </p>
          <p>The collision was indeed devastating.</p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren was clearly superior to that of the Sima Clan
            Leader as he was able to draw a stronger source of power from the
            Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The torrential force of the Empyrean Neptune’s Trident Halberd
            effortlessly sliced through the golden sword ray and brutally
            crashed into the Sima Clan Leader’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his Boundary Emperor Physique, the Sima Clan Leader could
            not withstand it and was blasted away by the overwhelming power of
            the Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>The golden longsword slipped through his hand.</p>
          <p>“That’s not good!”</p>
          <p>
            The Sima Clan Leader was horrified and immediately tried to recall
            his Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately for him, a boundless mind power abruptly encased the
            Emperor Weapon, rendering his recall attempt futile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren vanished in his position and reappeared before the
            Emperor Weapon as he gripped onto the handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor Weapon flashed with a glorious sword ray and jerked
            violently as if it was resisting Chu Kuangren’s ownership.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, still resisting, I see? Now yield before me!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren lightly grunted and unleashed his Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart’s Aura and his Supreme Sage’s spiritual
            energies!
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, the Emperor Weapon halted its movement and did not resist any
            further.

          </div>
          <p>
            “How’s that possible?!” The Sima Clan Leader was appalled, to say
            the least.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like that, the Sima Clan Leader felt the bond between him and
            his Emperor Weapon severed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems like you’ve never gotten the Emperor Weapon’s
            acknowledgment. You merely did some simple refinement,” Chu Kuangren
            said.
          </p>
          <p>Indeed.</p>
          <p>
            If the Sima Clan Leader had done a more thorough job in refining the
            weapon, even Chu Kuangren’s Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart
            would not have earned the weapon’s loyalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only explanation was that the Sima Clan Leader had done a
            horrible job in refining the weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, it was difficult to blame the Sima Clan Leader. Emperor
            Weapons were typically rebellious entities that could not be refined
            easily. Without its acknowledgment, most cultivators could not
            become the rightful owners of the weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            At most, they could only acquire the weapon’s permission to use
            them.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it!” The Sima Clan Leader stared at Chu Kuangren in envy.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had unraveled the fullest potential of his physique,
            yet he had managed to tame the Emperor Weapon in such a short amount
            of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed that the Sima Clan had really lost an Emperor Weapon now.
            What a great loss!
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s run!”</p>
          <p>The Gu Clan Leader was determined to leave.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was so powerful that not even the four of them could
            harm him in any meaningful way. On the other hand, the Snow Lion
            Tribe Leader was heavily injured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that their opponent had acquired an additional Emperor Weapon,
            there was no way they could even level the playing field.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they hesitated any further, this might just become their burial
            ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the Snow Spider Tribe Leader panicked as she turned around and
            attempted to flee.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the Snow Lion Tribe Leader, he was still helplessly held down
            by Chu Kuangren’s Mountain Rune. Hence, he could not move a single
            inch.
          </p>
          <p>‘F*ck my life!’</p>
          <p>Those b*stards did not even think of taking him with them.</p>
          <p>“Thinking about leaving now? How naive.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren chuckled lightly.</p>
          <p>
            He simply lifted his hand and unleashed a wave of mythical
            Sword-based Daoist Rhymes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Daoist Rhymes spread in all directions and formed a giant circle
            of twelve large sword qi pillars!
          </p>
          <p>
            In an instant, the entire space was sealed by the presence of the
            terrifying sword qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart’s Daoist Physique
            Transformation, the Nine Heaven Sword Prison!” the Sima Clan Leader
            said worryingly.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it! Let’s break it!”</p>
          <p>The Gu Clan Leader launched his spear fiercely into the air.</p>
          <p>
            The frightening spear ray darted across the realm like a fearsome
            dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a loud boom, the spear ray flew into the void and penetrated
            through the sword qi.
          </p>

          <p>
            It ripped a large hole through the sword qi that once covered the
            sky.
          </p>
          <p>“I did it!” The Gu Clan Leader was delighted.</p>
          <p>Just then.</p>
          <p>A line of silver runes fell from the sky.</p>
          <p>
            A burst of forbidden sealing force ensued, sealing the entire region
            in position. The Gu Clan Leader’s body immediately froze in the
            middle of the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the gaping hole of the Nine Heaven Sword Prison had been
            patched.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ve told you. It’s too late to leave now.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren whispered into the ears of the Gu Clan Leader.</p>
          <p>
            Then, a single ray of purple sword ray abruptly shot out and
            devoured the Gu Clan Leader whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            In split seconds, the observers witnessed the Gu Clan Leader’s body
            reduced into pulps while he was still in mid-air.
          </p>
          <p>A leader of a past-ancient orthodoxy had perished!</p>
          <p>
            It was a frightening scene that shook all of the cultivators
            present.
          </p>
          <p>“Run, run!”</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Spider Tribe Leader managed to break free of the Spatial
            Cessation Rune’s effect and dove recklessly into the distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, just like the Gu Clan Leader, her attempt was fruitless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren expanded his mind power, forming countless runic swords
            in the air that blocked the Snow Spider Tribe Leader’s escape route.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren dashed forward and arrived directly behind the Snow
            Spider Tribe Leader.
          </p>
          <p>“Stay away from me!”</p>
          <p>
            Sensing the chilling presence behind her back, the Snow Lion Tribe
            Leader squealed in terror and revealed her true form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her light-toned skin ruptured, revealing an enormous, white-furred
            arachnid spider beneath. n0𝐕𝑬𝓵𝑢𝐒𝒃.𝐂0𝔪
          </p>
          <p>
            The spider let out a deafening screech as it attempted to stab Chu
            Kuangren with its pedipalps.
          </p>
          <p>“Die!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren drew the Self Descendant Sword and activated the
            Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            A ray of glamorous sword ray descended from above, slicing the Snow
            Spider Tribe Leader’s pedipalps off before it fell onto the rest of
            her body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi immediately sliced her enormous body into halves.
            Copious amounts of blood spurted out and dyed a large patch of snow
            into crimson red.
          </p>
          <p>The Snow Lion Tribe Leader was dead!</p>
          <p>“Two more left now!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren glanced at the Snow Lion Tribe Leader and mobilized his
            spiritual thought, forming an enormous runic sword above his target.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like a falling comet, the runic sword mercilessly crashed through
            the Snow Lion Tribe Leader.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having sustained heavy injuries, the defenseless Snow Lion Tribe
            Leader perished instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the observers could process most of what was happening, three
            out of four orthodoxy leaders had fallen!
          </p>
          <p>
            The cultivators that had gathered around Heavenly Pool Mountain
            stared at Chu Kuangren in disbelief. They had nothing but the utmost

            Chapter 512: Taming An Emperor Weapon, Consecutively Defeating
            Boundary Emperors
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Up in the air, the Sima Clan Leader suddenly drew a golden
            longsword.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blade was embedded with lines of runic scriptures and emitted a
            magnificent oppressive presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the Emperor’s Aura. That’s an Emperor Weapon.” Chu Kuangren
            squinted his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Little brat, it’s about time I show you the power of the Sima
            clan’s Emperor Weapon!” the Sima Clan Leader announced loudly. With
            the abrupt swing of his blade, he unleashed a streak of golden sword
            qi that shot downwards on Chu Kuangren like a golden dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi shattered parts of the realms, leaving traces of white
            crevices in its path.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You speak as if I don’t own one myself,” Chu Kuangren said
            indifferently before he lifted his hand and summoned a golden
            halberd.
          </p>
          <p>It was none other than the Empyrean Neptune’s Trident Halberd.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren swung his halberd and unleashed the earth-shattering
            force of the ferocious ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            The golden sword ray and the majestic torrential force collided
            violently.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clash of the Emperor Weapons’ power created an impact as strong
            as one hundred thousand mountains colliding into one. Its
            frightening aftermath shattered almost half of Heavenly Pool
            Mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having been forced to retreat several dozens of kilometers due to
            the blast wave, the observing Sages stared at the Heavenly Pool
            Mountain in horror.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Such energy can only be the result of the crossing of two Emperor
            Weapons. Oh dear, that b*stard has an Emperor Weapon of his own!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Neither the past ancient nor even archaic ancient orthodoxies
            possess many Emperor Weapons. Yet, that b*stard’s carrying an
            Emperor Weapon of his own! How rich must his orthodoxy be for their
            sky-pride to be carrying an Emperor Weapon around?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The clash of the Emperor Weapons is too powerful. Let’s not get too
            near.”
          </p>
          <p>The collision was indeed devastating.</p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren was clearly superior to that of the Sima Clan
            Leader as he was able to draw a stronger source of power from the
            Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The torrential force of the Empyrean Neptune’s Trident Halberd
            effortlessly sliced through the golden sword ray and brutally
            crashed into the Sima Clan Leader’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his Boundary Emperor Physique, the Sima Clan Leader could
            not withstand it and was blasted away by the overwhelming power of
            the Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>The golden longsword slipped through his hand.</p>
          <p>“That’s not good!”</p>
          <p>
            The Sima Clan Leader was horrified and immediately tried to recall
            his Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately for him, a boundless mind power abruptly encased the
            Emperor Weapon, rendering his recall attempt futile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren vanished in his position and reappeared before the
            Emperor Weapon as he gripped onto the handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor Weapon flashed with a glorious sword ray and jerked
            violently as if it was resisting Chu Kuangren’s ownership.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, still resisting, I see? Now yield before me!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren lightly grunted and unleashed his Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart’s Aura and his Supreme Sage’s spiritual
            energies!
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, the Emperor Weapon halted its movement and did not resist any
            further.

          </div>
          <p>
            “How’s that possible?!” The Sima Clan Leader was appalled, to say
            the least.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like that, the Sima Clan Leader felt the bond between him and
            his Emperor Weapon severed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems like you’ve never gotten the Emperor Weapon’s
            acknowledgment. You merely did some simple refinement,” Chu Kuangren
            said.
          </p>
          <p>Indeed.</p>
          <p>
            If the Sima Clan Leader had done a more thorough job in refining the
            weapon, even Chu Kuangren’s Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart
            would not have earned the weapon’s loyalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only explanation was that the Sima Clan Leader had done a
            horrible job in refining the weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, it was difficult to blame the Sima Clan Leader. Emperor
            Weapons were typically rebellious entities that could not be refined
            easily. Without its acknowledgment, most cultivators could not
            become the rightful owners of the weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            At most, they could only acquire the weapon’s permission to use
            them.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it!” The Sima Clan Leader stared at Chu Kuangren in envy.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had unraveled the fullest potential of his physique,
            yet he had managed to tame the Emperor Weapon in such a short amount
            of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed that the Sima Clan had really lost an Emperor Weapon now.
            What a great loss!
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s run!”</p>
          <p>The Gu Clan Leader was determined to leave.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was so powerful that not even the four of them could
            harm him in any meaningful way. On the other hand, the Snow Lion
            Tribe Leader was heavily injured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that their opponent had acquired an additional Emperor Weapon,
            there was no way they could even level the playing field.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they hesitated any further, this might just become their burial
            ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the Snow Spider Tribe Leader panicked as she turned around and
            attempted to flee.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the Snow Lion Tribe Leader, he was still helplessly held down
            by Chu Kuangren’s Mountain Rune. Hence, he could not move a single
            inch.
          </p>
          <p>‘F*ck my life!’</p>
          <p>Those b*stards did not even think of taking him with them.</p>
          <p>“Thinking about leaving now? How naive.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren chuckled lightly.</p>
          <p>
            He simply lifted his hand and unleashed a wave of mythical
            Sword-based Daoist Rhymes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Daoist Rhymes spread in all directions and formed a giant circle
            of twelve large sword qi pillars!
          </p>
          <p>
            In an instant, the entire space was sealed by the presence of the
            terrifying sword qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart’s Daoist Physique
            Transformation, the Nine Heaven Sword Prison!” the Sima Clan Leader
            said worryingly.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it! Let’s break it!”</p>
          <p>The Gu Clan Leader launched his spear fiercely into the air.</p>
          <p>
            The frightening spear ray darted across the realm like a fearsome
            dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a loud boom, the spear ray flew into the void and penetrated
            through the sword qi.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">

            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            It ripped a large hole through the sword qi that once covered the
            sky.
          </p>
          <p>“I did it!” The Gu Clan Leader was delighted.</p>
          <p>Just then.</p>
          <p>A line of silver runes fell from the sky.</p>
          <p>
            A burst of forbidden sealing force ensued, sealing the entire region
            in position. The Gu Clan Leader’s body immediately froze in the
            middle of the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the gaping hole of the Nine Heaven Sword Prison had been
            patched.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ve told you. It’s too late to leave now.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren whispered into the ears of the Gu Clan Leader.</p>
          <p>
            Then, a single ray of purple sword ray abruptly shot out and
            devoured the Gu Clan Leader whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            In split seconds, the observers witnessed the Gu Clan Leader’s body
            reduced into pulps while he was still in mid-air.
          </p>
          <p>A leader of a past-ancient orthodoxy had perished!</p>
          <p>
            It was a frightening scene that shook all of the cultivators
            present.
          </p>
          <p>“Run, run!”</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Spider Tribe Leader managed to break free of the Spatial
            Cessation Rune’s effect and dove recklessly into the distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, just like the Gu Clan Leader, her attempt was fruitless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren expanded his mind power, forming countless runic swords
            in the air that blocked the Snow Spider Tribe Leader’s escape route.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren dashed forward and arrived directly behind the Snow
            Spider Tribe Leader.
          </p>
          <p>“Stay away from me!”</p>
          <p>
            Sensing the chilling presence behind her back, the Snow Lion Tribe
            Leader squealed in terror and revealed her true form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her light-toned skin ruptured, revealing an enormous, white-furred
            arachnid spider beneath. n0𝐕𝑬𝓵𝑢𝐒𝒃.𝐂0𝔪

          <p>
            The spider let out a deafening screech as it attempted to stab Chu
            Kuangren with its pedipalps.
          </p>
          <p>“Die!”</p>

            Chu Kuangren drew the Self Descendant Sword and activated the

            A ray of glamorous sword ray descended from above, slicing the Snow

            The clash of the Emperor Weapons’ power created an impact as strong
            as one hundred thousand mountains colliding into one. Its
            frightening aftermath shattered almost half of Heavenly Pool
            Mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having been forced to retreat several dozens of kilometers due to
            the blast wave, the observing Sages stared at the Heavenly Pool
            Mountain in horror.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Such energy can only be the result of the crossing of two Emperor
            Weapons. Oh dear, that b*stard has an Emperor Weapon of his own!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Neither the past ancient nor even archaic ancient orthodoxies
            possess many Emperor Weapons. Yet, that b*stard’s carrying an
            Emperor Weapon of his own! How rich must his orthodoxy be for their
            sky-pride to be carrying an Emperor Weapon around?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The clash of the Emperor Weapons is too powerful. Let’s not get too
            near.”
          </p>
          <p>The collision was indeed devastating.</p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren was clearly superior to that of the Sima Clan
            Leader as he was able to draw a stronger source of power from the
            Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The torrential force of the Empyrean Neptune’s Trident Halberd
            effortlessly sliced through the golden sword ray and brutally
            crashed into the Sima Clan Leader’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his Boundary Emperor Physique, the Sima Clan Leader could
            not withstand it and was blasted away by the overwhelming power of
            the Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>The golden longsword slipped through his hand.</p>
          <p>“That’s not good!”</p>
          <p>
            The Sima Clan Leader was horrified and immediately tried to recall
            his Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately for him, a boundless mind power abruptly encased the
            Emperor Weapon, rendering his recall attempt futile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren vanished in his position and reappeared before the
            Emperor Weapon as he gripped onto the handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor Weapon flashed with a glorious sword ray and jerked
            violently as if it was resisting Chu Kuangren’s ownership.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, still resisting, I see? Now yield before me!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren lightly grunted and unleashed his Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart’s Aura and his Supreme Sage’s spiritual
            energies!
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, the Emperor Weapon halted its movement and did not resist any
            further.

          <p>
            “How’s that possible?!” The Sima Clan Leader was appalled, to say
            the least.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like that, the Sima Clan Leader felt the bond between him and
            his Emperor Weapon severed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems like you’ve never gotten the Emperor Weapon’s
            acknowledgment. You merely did some simple refinement,” Chu Kuangren
            said.
          </p>
          <p>Indeed.</p>
          <p>
            If the Sima Clan Leader had done a more thorough job in refining the
            weapon, even Chu Kuangren’s Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart
            would not have earned the weapon’s loyalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only explanation was that the Sima Clan Leader had done a
            horrible job in refining the weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, it was difficult to blame the Sima Clan Leader. Emperor
            Weapons were typically rebellious entities that could not be refined
            easily. Without its acknowledgment, most cultivators could not
            become the rightful owners of the weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            At most, they could only acquire the weapon’s permission to use
            them.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it!” The Sima Clan Leader stared at Chu Kuangren in envy.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had unraveled the fullest potential of his physique,
            yet he had managed to tame the Emperor Weapon in such a short amount
            of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed that the Sima Clan had really lost an Emperor Weapon now.
            What a great loss!
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s run!”</p>
          <p>The Gu Clan Leader was determined to leave.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was so powerful that not even the four of them could
            harm him in any meaningful way. On the other hand, the Snow Lion
            Tribe Leader was heavily injured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that their opponent had acquired an additional Emperor Weapon,
            there was no way they could even level the playing field.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they hesitated any further, this might just become their burial
            ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the Snow Spider Tribe Leader panicked as she turned around and
            attempted to flee.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the Snow Lion Tribe Leader, he was still helplessly held down
            by Chu Kuangren’s Mountain Rune. Hence, he could not move a single
            inch.
          </p>
          <p>‘F*ck my life!’</p>
          <p>Those b*stards did not even think of taking him with them.</p>
          <p>“Thinking about leaving now? How naive.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren chuckled lightly.</p>
          <p>
            He simply lifted his hand and unleashed a wave of mythical
            Sword-based Daoist Rhymes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Daoist Rhymes spread in all directions and formed a giant circle
            of twelve large sword qi pillars!
          </p>
          <p>
            In an instant, the entire space was sealed by the presence of the
            terrifying sword qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart’s Daoist Physique
            Transformation, the Nine Heaven Sword Prison!” the Sima Clan Leader
            said worryingly.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it! Let’s break it!”</p>
          <p>The Gu Clan Leader launched his spear fiercely into the air.</p>
          <p>
            The frightening spear ray darted across the realm like a fearsome
            dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a loud boom, the spear ray flew into the void and penetrated
            through the sword qi.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            It ripped a large hole through the sword qi that once covered the
            sky.
          </p>
          <p>“I did it!” The Gu Clan Leader was delighted.</p>
          <p>Just then.</p>
          <p>A line of silver runes fell from the sky.</p>
          <p>
            A burst of forbidden sealing force ensued, sealing the entire region
            in position. The Gu Clan Leader’s body immediately froze in the
            middle of the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the gaping hole of the Nine Heaven Sword Prison had been
            patched.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ve told you. It’s too late to leave now.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren whispered into the ears of the Gu Clan Leader.</p>
          <p>
            Then, a single ray of purple sword ray abruptly shot out and
            devoured the Gu Clan Leader whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            In split seconds, the observers witnessed the Gu Clan Leader’s body
            reduced into pulps while he was still in mid-air.
          </p>
          <p>A leader of a past-ancient orthodoxy had perished!</p>
          <p>
            It was a frightening scene that shook all of the cultivators
            present.
          </p>
          <p>“Run, run!”</p>
          <p>
            The Snow Spider Tribe Leader managed to break free of the Spatial
            Cessation Rune’s effect and dove recklessly into the distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, just like the Gu Clan Leader, her attempt was fruitless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren expanded his mind power, forming countless runic swords
            in the air that blocked the Snow Spider Tribe Leader’s escape route.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren dashed forward and arrived directly behind the Snow
            Spider Tribe Leader.
          </p>
          <p>“Stay away from me!”</p>
          <p>
            Sensing the chilling presence behind her back, the Snow Lion Tribe
            Leader squealed in terror and revealed her true form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her light-toned skin ruptured, revealing an enormous, white-furred
            arachnid spider beneath. n0𝐕𝑬𝓵𝑢𝐒𝒃.𝐂0𝔪
          </p>
          <p>
            The spider let out a deafening screech as it attempted to stab Chu
            Kuangren with its pedipalps.
          </p>
          <p>“Die!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren drew the Self Descendant Sword and activated the
            Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            A ray of glamorous sword ray descended from above, slicing the Snow
            Spider Tribe Leader’s pedipalps off before it fell onto the rest of
            her body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi immediately sliced her enormous body into halves.
            Copious amounts of blood spurted out and dyed a large patch of snow
            into crimson red.
          </p>
          <p>The Snow Lion Tribe Leader was dead!</p>
          <p>“Two more left now!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren glanced at the Snow Lion Tribe Leader and mobilized his
            spiritual thought, forming an enormous runic sword above his target.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like a falling comet, the runic sword mercilessly crashed through
            the Snow Lion Tribe Leader.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having sustained heavy injuries, the defenseless Snow Lion Tribe
            Leader perished instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the observers could process most of what was happening, three
            out of four orthodoxy leaders had fallen!
          </p>
          <p>
            The cultivators that had gathered around Heavenly Pool Mountain
            stared at Chu Kuangren in disbelief. They had nothing but the utmost
            admiration and fear for Chu Kuangren.

          <p>
            “I’m Swordsman San of the Sword Tribe, and I’m here to... kill you!”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Swordsman San uttered his threat, a surge of murderous intent
            spread out in a ten-kilometer radius.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unable to tolerate the unbearable murderous intent, some of the
            cultivators in the teahouse had even fainted over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren sat unfazed as he scanned the black-robed
            cultivator with his Eye of Revelation. By then, he had already
            gotten a clear picture of the man’s capability.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve heard the Sword Tribe has a division that’s known as the
            Shadow Swordsmen who are highly trained in the art of assassination.
            However, is it assassination if you just stomp in and scream? Are
            you stupid, or have you lost your mind?”
          </p>
          <p>“Kill me? More like, you’re here to be killed.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said faintly.</p>
          <p>Without hesitating further, Swordsman San made his move.</p>
          <p>
            A dark broadsword appeared in his hand. It was as big as half a door
            frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            The broadsword swung, unleashing a boundless amount of sword qi that
            shattered the table before Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren transformed the surrounding sword qi into an invisible
            shield that soaked the damage from the incoming sword technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It looks like you do have some decent skills after all.” Swordsman
            San appeared excited as he swung his sword again.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, his sword qi was unstoppable. Infused with an
            overpowering earth qi, the spiritual energy surged out toward Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was still indifferent in face of such a threatening
            attack.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s hilarious how you thought you could kill me with that.”</p>
          <p>
            He drew half of his Self-Descendant Sword from his hilt and summoned
            a striking purple sword ray.
          </p>
          <p>
            The devastating sword ray obliterated the incoming earth qi into
            pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, Swordsman San attempted to use his broadsword to shield the
            incoming attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the purple sword ray suddenly unleashed a terrifying amount
            of energy and blasted him dozens of kilometers away. Swordsman San
            crashed into one of the mountains.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>Dust and debris filled the air.</p>
          <p>His overwhelming aura soon dissipated.</p>
          <p>
            The cultivators at the teahouse took the opportunity to flee for
            their lives. None of them dared linger any longer.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh heavens, that’s a Shadow Swordsman from the Sword Tribe!”</p>
          <p>
            “Who’s that b*stard anyway? Why did the Sword Tribe send a Shadow
            Swordsman after him?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The cultivators of the teahouse ran as they questioned Chu
            Kuangren’s identity.

            The Shadow Swordsmen was a highly classified division of the Sword

            or how powerful they were.
          </p>
          <p>
            What everyone did know was that whoever became the Shadow
            Swordsmen’s target were enemies of the Sword Tribe, and almost none
            of them had a happy ending.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Tribe was one of the most terrifying entities in the

            “Haha, your abilities are indeed remarkable. I can recognize your
            sword qi. It’s the same as Master Daoist’s Exquisite Nine Orifices
            Sword Heart.”
          </p>
          <p>Swordsman San’s voice echoed from the mountains.</p>
          <p>
            He was seen levitating upwards as he unleashed another blast of
            hefty aura, and his dark broadsword was now emitting surges of
            mythical Daoist Rhymes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything within a ten thousand kilometer radius in the mountains
            shook.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren could sense that a copious amount of earth qi was
            converging towards Swordsman San.
          </p>
          <p>He was transforming earth qi into sword qi!</p>
          <p>
            Such a Sword Dao that allowed one to convert earth qi into sword qi
            was pretty sophisticated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren squinted his eyes and said, “It seems like he’s no
            weaker than the Sima Clan Leader.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman San’s ability had piqued Chu Kuangren’s interest in the
            Sword Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this was a single swordsman’s ability, it was difficult to
            imagine just how strong the entire tribe would be.
          </p>
          <p>“Mountainous Overgrowth, attack!”</p>
          <p>With a low grunt, Swordsman San unleashed his sword technique.</p>
          <p>
            The lofty sword qi interlocked in the void and formed a display of
            enormous yellow sword shadow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the sword shadow was an ever-changing scenery of mountain
            ranges. In a second, its boundless aura had sealed everything within
            ten kilometers of Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>“Qingxue, step behind me.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said calmly.</p>
          <p>
            Then, he swung his Self Descendant Sword and unleashed a fury of
            calamitous sword rays.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a bang, the sword shadow shattered into pieces before Chu
            Kuangren’s sword ray.
          </p>
          <p>The alluring scenery faded away like bubbles.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had countered his mountainous technique with a single
            sword technique!
          </p>
          <p>“That’s powerful!”</p>
          <p>
            Since the Swordsman San’s sword shadow was destroyed, the remaining
            shock wave sent him flying several hundred meters backward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shocked, he began to feel overwhelmed by a sense of anxiety that he
            had never felt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman San swung his sword around, summoning multiple sword
            shadows this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The surrounding earth qi gravitated towards him as if he had
            awakened.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman San flung his sword around and unleashed nine consecutive
            strikes, with each strike more powerful than the last.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he was at the ninth strike, it seemed like Swordsman San had
            accumulated the momentum of all previous movements into one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once he released the final technique, the void shook in his
            astonishing force of power.
          </p>
          <p>The sky felt as if it was going to collapse under its weight.</p>
          <p>
            It was Swordsman San’s strongest technique, a move that was birthed
            out of his thorough understanding of the Mountain Dao!
          </p>
          <p>“Now, this is something.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren gently lifted his hand and activated all three Daoist
            Physique Transformations of his Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of his Supreme Foundation Levels were radiated in their glories.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a single sword technique, Chu Kuangren unleashed an
            unfathomable sword ray that eclipsed the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mountainous sword qi was once again ripped apart by Chu
            Kuangren’s purple sword ray.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Swordsman San was clear this time that he was no match for
            Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that, he mobilized his spiritual energy, transformed into a ray
            of light, and dove into the distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just when Chu Kuangren was about to give chase, he felt an
            overwhelming gravitational force grasping onto his legs.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, it’s the earth qi that came from the sword qi...”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren realized that the Swordsman San’s sword qi, which he
            had shattered, did not truly dissipate. Instead, it had burrowed
            itself into the ground and was reformed into the earth qi that was
            now trapping Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had to admit that such a method was indeed impressive,
            or at least it would be when dealing with some Boundary Emperors.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Such a trick would probably be useful for other opponents, but
            alas, you’re against me today.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren lifted his feet out and stomped mercilessly on the
            sprouting sword qi into nothingness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, he mobilized his spiritual thoughts and locked onto Swordsman
            San’s position.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a member of the Shadow Swordsmen, Swordsman San’s combat strength
            was highly sophisticated, and every single Swordsman cultivated a
            specialized technique of their own. When he vanished into the
            shadows, many cultivators were clueless as to where he had gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Swordsman San could not escape from Chu Kuangren’s
            spiritual thought sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            “How convenient for you to run after realizing that you can’t defeat
            me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Using his invisible mind power, Chu Kuangren formed lines of runes
            in the air that sealed Swordsman San’s escape route.
          </p>
          <p>With a leap forward, he too vanished without a trace.</p>
          <p>
            When Chu Kuangren eventually reappeared, he was right in front of
            Swordsman San.
          </p>
          <p>“Die!”</p>
          <p>
            His cold, brutal tone was reminiscent of that of the Grim Reaper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lines of runes formed into a wide sword net that ensnared Swordsman
            San.
          </p>
          <p>
            The runic swords fell all over Swordsman San like a pouring rain!
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman San attempted to defend himself with all his might by
            summoning even a defensive Boundary Emperor Weapon on his chest.
          </p>
          <p>Even then, the injury he sustained was far from minor.</p>
          <p>
            After enduring the falling runic swords, a light blue rune appeared
            above his head before Swordsman San had the time to heave a sigh of
            relief.
          </p>
          <p>The rune was seething with tiny electrical discharges.</p>
          <p>It was the Emperor-grade Lightning Rune!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>
            Chapter 516: Killing Swordsman San, The War Has Begun Long Ago
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>Emperor-grade Lightning Rune, strike!</p>
          <p>The azure blue Lightning Rune hovered atop Chu Kuangren’s head.</p>
          <p>
            Immediately after, a vicious Thunder Dragon swooped out, and
            Tremendous Heavenly Might surged, enveloping Swordsman San in full.
          </p>
          <p>“What... What is this?! Heavenly tribulation??”</p>
          <p>Swordsman San was incredibly terrified.</p>
          <p>
            Just as he wanted to run, that Thunder Dragon was already charging
            down at him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ferocious lightning energy nearly corroded every part of
            Swordsman San’s body in an instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the numbing effect of the lightning was so strong that he
            could not even wail in pain.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a few moments, the rays of lightning subsided, leaving only a
            charred body on the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren reached out and took away his adversary’s Yin and Yang
            Ring to do a brief search through it. It was then he found a
            communication compass within.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before he could utter a single word, the communication compass
            vibrated on it’s own.
          </p>
          <p>
            He injected his spiritual power into it, linking the communication
            compass to its receiver.
          </p>
          <p>“Swordsman San, how did your mission go?”</p>
          <p>
            A middle-aged man’s voice was heard from the other side of the
            communication compass.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Judging from your tone and the fact that you could contact
            Swordsman San, I’m guessing that you’re one of Sword Tribe’s higher
            executives?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren held onto the communication compass and smiled gently.
          </p>
          <p>
            That voice on the other side of the communication compass fell
            silent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, that person started speaking again. “You are... Chu Kuangren?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it ended with a question mark, that person’s tone sounded
            quite certain.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s right. It’s me.”</p>
          <p>
            “I’m the Sword Tribe Leader.” That voice on the other end of the
            communication compass delivered another exciting news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren replied cheekily when he heard that. “Hey, what a
            coincidence this is. If you really are the Sword Tribe Leader, I
            happen to have something I want to discuss with you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “What is it? Are you pleading for mercy?” The Sword Tribe Leader
            said nonchalantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            From his perspective, no one would feel unafraid when facing such a
            large-scaled organization like them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding to the fact that Chu Kuangren was an outside world sky-pride
            and that Black Heaven Sect was lesser-known here, he really did not
            have anyone to rely upon in the Emperor Road.

          </div>
          <p>
            “Nah. I just wanted to let you know that if you intend on
            assassinating me again in the future, please at least send someone
            who is more competent. These laughing stock of yours have done
            nothing but embarrass your tribe. I’m fine too if you want to come
            over personally to kill me, but I hope you have prepared your will
            and coffin beforehand. I only kill, and I don’t do burials.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After Chu Kuangren finished his sentence, silence took over once
            again.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re waging war against the Sword Tribe?!”</p>
          <p>
            It was clear from the Sword Tribe Leader’s tone of voice that he was
            starting to get agitated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the many years, this was the first time someone was
            daring enough to speak to him like that.
          </p>
          <p>“Waging a war? You idiot. The war has already begun long ago!”</p>
          <p>
            Once Chu Kuangren finished speaking, sword qi swirled within his
            palm, and he disintegrated the communication compass right there and
            then.
          </p>
          <p>Some communication compasses had a tracking function.</p>
          <p>
            If he were to bring it with him, it would undoubtedly reveal his
            location to his enemies.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s leave.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said to Shang Qingxue. When the two of them passed by a
            teahouse, they tossed out a couple of dozen soul emblems.
          </p>
          <p>“Here. Take this as compensation for your teahouse.”</p>
          <p>“Many thanks, Master. Many thanks.”</p>
          <p>
            The teahouse owner was moved to tears. With that, he packed up his
            stuff and quickly went back on the road.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, about ten kilometers out, a gaze was locked onto the
            place where Chu Kuangren battled Swordsman San.
          </p>
          <p>It was an old man donned in long black robes.</p>
          <p>
            “This guy’s combat strength is truly not one to look down on. I
            can’t believe he didn’t need to wield his Emperor Weapon to kill off
            Swordsman San.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems like brute force is not a good way to deal with this
            fella. I must make some necessary preparations before going for
            him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This old man was one of the three swordsmen who were sent here to
            assassinate Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            After witnessing Chu Kuangren’s combat strength, he realized that it
            was impossible to beat Chu Kuangren with his raw strength alone.
          </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, that did not mean that he had no other way.</p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Back at the other side, in the Sword Tribe.</p>
          <p>
            Sword Tribe Leader was so infuriated after he received Chu
            Kuangren’s message.
          </p>
          <p>
            “War! Very well, then. It has been so long since somebody has openly
            challenged us, Sword Tribe to a war! I’d like to see just how you’re
            going to deal with my Sword Tribe!”
          </p>
          <p>A stone-cold glint gleamed in Sword Tribe Leader’s eyes.</p>
          <p>
            His Sword Tribe was a hugely successful empire, and their scale of
            resources was not something the other past ancient orthodoxies could
            compare with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their true wealth is simply unfathomable, for the massive resources
            they owned had been passed down for generations since archaic
            ancient times!

          <p>
            There are two new visitors to Seven Chord City, one man and one
            woman.
          </p>
          <p>
            These two people’s faces were shrouded with faint spiritual light,
            hence their appearances were blurry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only thing people could tell was their extraordinary demeanors,
            especially the young man who was in front. He had an almost
            otherworldly demeanor, as though he would ascend to immortality at
            any moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            These two were Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue, who had come to Seven
            Chord City because they heard that a grand event would take place
            here soon.
          </p>
          <p>There were a lot of cultivators on Seven Chord City’s streets.</p>
          <p>Among them were quite a number of elites, too.</p>
          <p>
            Moreover, a large portion of the cultivators held various musical
            instruments in their hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Melodious tunes would be heard from the inns on both sides of the
            street from time to time, which was very pleasant to the ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to the other cities where cultivators gather, Seven Chords
            City had a slightly more elegant presence. Many cultivators who pass
            by here carry a certain carefree temperament to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sect Leader, this Seven Chord City looks like a really unique
            place.” Shang Qingxue exclaimed admirably. She had never seen a
            cultivator city quite like this one.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s definitely quite fascinating.”</p>
          <p>
            After that, they looked for an inn for their temporary stay before
            utilizing their free time to scout for more info about this place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Very soon, Chu Kuangren had gotten all he needed to fully understand
            the forces in Seven Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were indeed many cultivation forces in Seven Chord City, but
            for Chu Kuangren, most of them were not worth mentioning at all. The
            only organization worth his attention was the Seven Chord Guqin
            Association.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Seven Chord Guqin Association was an organization formed
            together by the musical forces in Seven Chord City. They had three
            presidents, each one representing a past ancient orthodoxy that was
            masterful at music. These were the Ji clan, Phantasmic Melodious
            Sect, and Melodious Void Sect respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            These three forces all had roots tracing back to the past ancient
            era, so they were all incredibly powerful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor Weapon that was rumored to have surfaced recently was
            also guarded by these three forces in turn. They intended to wait
            until the Infinity Guqin Banquet before presenting it to the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            By then, all musical cultivators could showcase their respective
            prowess and see whom the Emperor Weapon would acknowledge as its
            owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            “When this Emperor Weapon first revealed itself to the world, dark
            ominous clouds shadowed the sky for three days, accompanied with
            incessant rumbling thunder. Since I’m lacking a good guqin now, I
            might fancy my chances at competing for this one.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren muttered under his breath.</p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, competing for an Emperor Weapon was never as easy as
            it sounded because its success still depended on whether the Emperor
            Weapon would acknowledge you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, the great Sect Leader Chu, who had been slacking off on his
            guqin Dao, decided to freshen up on his knowledge and skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, he would find out how many guqin cultivators in
            this city had the ability to compete with him for that Emperor-grade
            guqin.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Chapter 517: Seven Chord City’s Forces, Guqin Festival, Meeting Feng
            Yaorao Again
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Two days later, Chu Kuangren had already gone through the Eight
            Celestial Demonic Chords once.
          </p>
          <p>
            After progressing to a Sage and the huge amounts of purple haze had
            altered his soul, his cognizance had improved by leaps and bounds.
            Coupling that with his Meditational Clarity Trait, he now had a
            whole new understanding of this Emperor Technique after going
            through it once. As such, his level in guqin Dao had improved by
            another tier.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s about time I go check out if there are any impressive guqin
            cultivators in Seven Chord City.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren mumbled.</p>
          <p>
            He had already tasked this job to Shang Qingxue, requesting her to
            collect some intel.
          </p>
          <p>Hence, she should have some conclusive evidence by now.</p>
          <p>
            When he summoned Shang Qingxue back, she had indeed gathered quite a
            lot of information.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Li Changyin, a sky-pride amongst the younger generation of
            Phantasmic Melodious Sect. He is skilled at playing the guqin, the
            flute, and various other musical instruments. He was once regarded
            as a peerless genius that is only seen every once in a million
            years...”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ji Xiaoyao, Ji clan’s finest sky-pride. He is most skilled in guqin
            Dao, especially in the Ji clan’s famous song, the Limitless Song...”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yang Xiyun, Melodious Void Sect’s dame. She is skilled in guqin Dao
            as well. She has already attained the Seven-Step Great Sage Realm in
            her cultivation. She is powerful enough to cross realms and
            challenge Sage Rulers...”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s lips curled up as he read the various information
            that Shang Qingxue had collected. “You’ve done well.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, right. Sect Leader, I’ve just received news that Melodious Void
            Sect’s Yang Xiyun is planning to organize a guqin festival at
            Cloudveil Pavilion before the Infinite Guqin Banquet commences.
            There will be a huge amount of guqin cultivators gathering there.
            Why don’t we attend it?” Shang Qingxue said excitedly.
          </p>
          <p>“Sounds like a good idea.” Chu Kuangren gently nodded.</p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Cloudveil Pavilion.</p>
          <p>
            It was the biggest, and most high-class inn in the entire Seven
            Chord City. This place was often the venue for a guqin master who
            intended to hold guqin festivals.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this night, many cultivators skilled in musical Dao were gathered
            in Cloudveil Pavilion.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue, too, were amongst the visitors.</p>
          <p>
            However, they were stopped just as they wanted to enter the place.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My two guests, apologies. The Cloudveil Pavilion has already been
            booked by Lady Yang. If you want to go inside, you must present your
            invitation card.”
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the inn’s workers, who was stationed outside to welcome the
            cultivators, told them apologetically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing this, Chu Kuangren could not help but fix a stare at
            Shang Qingxue, as if saying, “You didn’t say we needed an
            invitation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue put her palms together in a prayer sign and quickly
            apologized, “I’m really sorry, Sect Leader. It’s my mistake.”
          </p>
          <p>“What do we do now?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren stroked his chin, then stared toward the brightly lit
            Cloudveil Pavilion with a mischievous look.
          </p>
          <p>Were they going to break in?</p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914dfd5ed68b00364a4a98",
                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>This did not seem appropriate.</p>
          <p>
            Just when Chu Kuangren was trying to figure things out, two figures
            slowly walked toward them from a near distance.
          </p>
          <p>It was a male and a female.</p>
          <p>
            Among those two, the female cultivator was especially shocked when
            she saw the outline of Chu Kuangren’s figure from the back.
          </p>
          <p>“This figure and this energy... Could it be...”</p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator looked stunned. It was as if she had recalled
            something. n0𝗏𝞮𝓵𝚞𝑆𝕓.𝑪0𝓂
          </p>
          <p>
            That handsome young man beside her noticed Chu Kuangren’s figure
            too, and his eyebrow raised slightly.
          </p>
          <p>“Yaorao, do you know that guy?”</p>
          <p>The young man inquired.</p>
          <p>
            That female cultivator was the sky-pride who had made quite a name
            for herself on Firmament Star lately and wanted to challenge Chu
            Kuangren, Feng Yaorao.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m not sure if he’s who I think he is...” Feng Yaorao walked up to
            him with anticipation.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this moment, Chu Kuangren was still figuring out how best to get
            themselves into Cloudveil Pavilion. When looking at the cultivators
            who passed by him, a menacing look glinted in his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>Why not steal two invitation cards?</p>
          <p>“Brother Chu?”</p>
          <p>Just then, Feng Yaorao’s voice rang out from behind him.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren turned around, only to see Feng Yaorao. A look of
            surprise flashed in his eyes. “Are you that F-Feng... Sister Feng?”
          </p>
          <p>He did have a little impression of Feng Yaorao.</p>
          <p>
            However, he had forgotten her exact name. He had thought for a while
            but still failed to recall her name, so he could only greet her as
            ‘Sister’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feng Yaorao pouted when she heard that. She stared at him, upset.
            “You really are Brother Chu. I’ve been constantly thinking of you,
            Brother Chu, but I didn’t think you’d forget my name. I’m really
            saddened by this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside her, the handsome young man’s face stiffened for a moment.
          </p>
          <p>A man that Feng Yaorao had been constantly thinking of?!</p>
          <p>
            The young man stared at Chu Kuangren with hostility, but he
            retracted it after a short while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, Shang Qingxue had managed to catch sight of it, and she
            looked at that young man sympathetically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sigh, I hope this guy would be wise not to provoke the Sect Leader.
          </p>
          <p>Otherwise, it was going to be every man for himself.</p>
          <p>
            “Heh, I didn’t expect to see you here, Sister Feng. It’s fate, isn’t
            it?” Chu Kuangren coughed twice, trying to mask his awkwardness.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My name is Feng Yaorao. I hope Brother Chu will remember it this
            time. Right, are you both here to attend Lady Yang’s banquet too?”
          </p>
          <p>Feng Yaorao said.</p>
          <p>
            “Yes, but unfortunately, we don’t have an invitation card,” Chu
            Kuangren said helplessly.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            “I see. I have one here that I don’t mind giving it to Brother Chu,”
            Feng Yaorao said as she took out her invitation card.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside her, that handsome young man suddenly spoke, “Yaorao, no need
            for that trouble. I’m good friends with Sister Yang. Your two
            friends can just come in with us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “If they are your guests, Daoist Li, I wouldn’t have any problem
            with letting them in.”
          </p>
          <p>The inn’s worker immediately responded with a flattering smile.</p>
          <p>
            He clearly knew who this young man was and recognized the latter’s
            higher status.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren activated his Eye of Revelation and glanced at that
            young man.
          </p>
          <p>“Li Changyin, Phantasmic Melody Sect’s Daoist...”</p>
          <p>“So, it’s him.” Reality dawned on Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>
            Li Changyin was crowned as the once-in-a-lifetime genius in
            Phantasmic Melody Sect. Hence, he was very reputable in Seven Chord
            City.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Li Changyin’s aid, Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue got into
            Cloudveil Pavilion.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>“Lady Yang holding a guqin festival is a truly rare occasion.”</p>
          <p>“That’s right. I can’t possibly miss this grand event.”</p>
          <p>
            “I’m sure the people here today have not only come to listen to Lady
            Yang’s melodious tune, but also to admire her good looks.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ha! In all honesty, that is my intention.”</p>
          <p>
            The crowd was buzzing inside Cloudveil Pavilion as many musical
            cultivators had gathered here.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Chu Kuangren’s group entered the scene, quite a number of
            cultivators glanced over. However, since no one could see Chu
            Kuangren’s face clearly because of the spiritual veil, everyone
            diverted their attention to Li Changyin beside him.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, Daoist Li is here.”</p>
          <p>“Daoist Li, long time no see.”</p>
          <p>
            “Daoist Li’s presence has really made the guqin banquet today more
            interesting. Come, please have a seat.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone was very respectful and admirable towards the handsome Li
            Changyin, and many of them flattered him with compliments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some female guqin masters even threw wistful glances at Li Changyin.
          </p>
          <p>For once, Chu Kuangren was a foil to someone else’s grace.</p>
          <p>
            This was a whole new experience for him, and he found it
            fascinating.
          </p>
          <p>
            He used to be the center of attraction wherever he went. Hence, now
            that he was cast aside, he felt a little weird.
          </p>
          <p>It even made him a little sentimental.</p>
          <p>So this was how it felt to be left out.</p>
          <p>
            Beside him, Li Changyin appeared to be enjoying the limelight. He
            smiled gently and said, “Come, everyone, let me introduce you to my
            friend, Feng Yaorao. Sister Feng, as for these two beside you...
            Right, why don’t you both take down your spiritual veils and let
            everybody get to know you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with Li Changyin’s words, the crowd then turned to look at Chu
            Kuangren and his companion.
          </p>
          <p>
            It came off quite disrespectful to the crowd that they were
            concealing their looks in a public event.
          </p>
          <p>“Apologies. I should have known better.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren smiled faintly before removing the spiritual veil on
            his face.

            Chapter 518: Way To Go Murong Xuan, Public Display Of Affection
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>“Apologies, I should’ve known better.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren smiled gently, then took off the spiritual veil on his
            face.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment his spiritual veil dissipated, silence befell the scene.
            Everybody stared at Chu Kuangren in awe, momentarily stunned.
          </p>
          <p>Those female guqin masters’ eyes even lit up.</p>
          <p>
            “Such a handsome gentleman... He must have descended from the
            heavens!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve been composing a song recently, a song that sings praise about
            the gods and goddesses in the heavens. My progress is stumped
            because I’m lacking inspiration, but now it seems that I’ve found
            one!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I can’t believe there can be such a peerless person in this world!”
          </p>
          <p>Li Changyin himself was shocked too.</p>
          <p>
            It was him who ordered Chu Kuangren to take down his spiritual veil,
            but he never expected that he would look so astounding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had stolen his limelight the instant the spiritual veil
            disappeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, he finally understood why Feng Yaorao was constantly thinking
            about him.
          </p>
          <p>If he were a woman, he would have done the same too!</p>
          <p>“May I ask for your name, my Lord?”</p>
          <p>
            “Which orthodoxy are you from, my Lord? Which genre of music do you
            usually play?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Those female cultivators who were staring wistfully at Li Changyin
            earlier could not hold back any longer. All of them stood up and
            started crowding around Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just now, they could still maintain their ladylike demeanor in front
            of Li Changyin.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when they saw someone of Chu Kuangren’s qualities, they
            could not care less about their reputation anymore. If they did not
            make the first move, somebody else might snatch him away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite facing such a large crowd of female cultivators fangirling
            over him, Chu Kuangren appeared unusually composed. He had already
            gotten used to this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that he handled this situation with such grace made the
            female cultivators even more attracted to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the remaining cultivators, a sense of bitterness pervaded
            their hearts. They really wished they could kick Chu Kuangren aside
            so that they could be at his spot.
          </p>
          <p>Right at this moment.</p>
          <p>
            Cloudveil Pavillion’s ceiling suddenly opened, and a ray of
            moonlight shone down from above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basking within the moonlight was a white-dressed woman, who was
            holding a guqin while slowly descending down.
          </p>
          <p>
            This woman had a graceful figure, exquisite facial features, and a
            cold temperament, just like a bright moon. She gave everyone an
            elusive persona.
          </p>
          <p>Every cultivator’s eyes lit up when they saw this person.</p>
          <p>“Lady Yang is here.”</p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            “The guqin that she’s holding must be one of Melodious Void Sect’s
            Seven Great Guqins, the Aqueous Moon.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yup. Lady Yang has finally arrived.”</p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun landed on one of Cloudveil Pavillion’s daisies and
            glanced at her surroundings. She bowed at the crowd. “Greetings, my
            fellow Brothers and Sisters. I’ve invited all of you here today
            mainly because I’ve composed a song about all the things I’ve been
            feeling lately. I wish all of you would give me a couple of
            reviews.”
          </p>
          <p>“Haha. It’s Lady Yang’s new song. I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah.”</p>
          <p>“Sect Leader. Sect Leader...”</p>
          <p>
            Right when Chu Kuangren was about to find a place to sit and enjoy
            the song, Shang Qingxue suddenly tucked on his sleeves from beside
            him. She was pointing to somewhere in the crowd.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren glanced toward that direction, and he was shocked.
            “It’s Murong Xuan.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Their sights landed on a man at a seat not far away from Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>It was, in fact, Murong Xuan!</p>
          <p>
            He must have just entered the hall not long ago. Otherwise, he would
            have noticed Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>“Bloody hell, this fella is here too.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was just about to walk over and ask how he has been
            doing lately.
          </p>
          <p>However, Shang Qingxue held him back.</p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, something is not right.”</p>
          <p>“Why?”</p>
          <p>
            “Look at Murong Xuan and Yang Xiyun. I think there’s... some spark
            between them.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren took a closer look at them upon hearing that.</p>
          <p>
            He, too, had noticed that there was something fishy going on between
            those two.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun was on stage, while Murong Xuan was below the stage among
            the audience. They were separated by dozens of people, yet their
            eyes were fixed on each other, and there was an intimacy in their
            eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, wow, Murong Xuan. Somebody’s getting freed from the single
            life, huh?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren exclaimed admirably and decided to leave him alone for
            the time being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue, who was at the side, was very surprised too. “These
            few days, while I was gathering intel about Yang Xiyun, my sources
            described her as a very cold and indifferent person. Anything not
            related to guqin will not have a place in her eyes. I can’t believe
            Murong Xuan has managed to break down her walls and win her over.
            Way to go, Murong Xuan!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Qingxue, if Murong Xuan and Yang Xiyun do end up becoming Daoist
            companions, what gifts do you think we Black Heaven Sect should
            bestow upon them?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ugh, Sect Leader, aren’t you counting the chickens before they
            hatch? They’re not even halfway there yet.”
          </p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue rolled her eyes as she said.</p>
          <p>
            Apart from Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue, the rest of the people
            had also noticed the way Yang Xiyun and Murong Xuan were looking at
            each other. n0𝗏𝖾𝓁𝓤𝚜𝑏.𝓒0𝓂
          </p>
          <p>Some of the male cultivators could not help but frown.</p>
          <p>“Who is this guy? Why does Lady Yang keep looking at him?”</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            “D*mn it. Don’t tell me Lady Yang’s heart already belongs to
            someone??”
          </p>
          <p>
            All the male cultivators looked annoyed at what they were seeing.
          </p>
          <p>To them, Yang Xiyun was the goddess of Seven Chord City.</p>
          <p>
            Now, their goddess’ heart had been stolen away by some unknown
            outsider. How were they supposed to bear with this??
          </p>
          <p>
            At this moment, up at the dais, Yang Xiyun started performing her
            new song.
          </p>
          <p>
            A beautiful melody began to fill the entire room. Guqin music
            reverberated the room, giving off joyous vibes and more so, a sense
            of everlasting love.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that instant, everybody’s hearts were filled with a sweet and
            enamored feeling.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that Yang Xiyun could tug at people’s heartstrings with
            guqin music alone went to show that her guqin Dao was already at a
            very high level.
          </p>
          <p>It would even be fair to regard her as a guqin virtuoso.</p>
          <p>
            “This song is wonderful. It is hands down the best song that I’ve
            ever heard.”
          </p>
          <p>“Lady Yang’s guqin skills have certainly scaled another level.”</p>
          <p>
            After Yang Xiyun finished performing the song, the audience looked
            at her with amazement.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, their eyes were met with the image of her looking down at
            Murong Xuan amongst the audience. There was an inexplicable fondness
            in their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>Adding that to that intimate song about love earlier...</p>
          <p>Every male cultivator could feel their hearts breaking.</p>
          <p>
            “Well played. Her intention was never to hold this guqin festival.
            This is clearly just a large-scale event for her to publicly display
            her affections and then brutally shatter her admirers’ hearts.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren shook his head in disapproval as he watched from the
            side.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Lady Yang, this song differs greatly from your previous style. I
            wonder why?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Li Changyin could no longer hold it as he stood up suddenly and
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            His question was exactly what everyone in the audience wanted to
            know.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that, a rare smile etched on Yang Xiyun’s face as if she had
            thought of something. “I met someone not long ago, and ever since
            then, much joy and blessing have been brought to my life. Hence, I
            made this song. Perhaps this is the unspoken resonance between
            people and music. It’s how I’ve been inspired to do this.”
          </p>
          <p>Upon hearing this, the crowd could almost hammer reality home.</p>
          <p>
            This Yang Xiyun had most certainly fallen in love. Otherwise, she
            would not have composed a song with such sentiments.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Lady Yang, I wonder if that person you mentioned is this brother
            right here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just then, another young man stood up. He pointed at Murong Xuan and
            said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun’s face blushed. Then, she explained with a smile, “This
            is my savior, Murong Xuan, Brother Murong.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She did not enclose the full details. Nevertheless, everyone could
            guess from her expression whether their speculation was true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding to the fact that she had used the word ‘savior’, several
            dozen scenes of a hero saving a damsel in distress immediately
            emerged in the crowd’s minds.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Everyone, we’re having a guqin festival today. Now that I’m done
            performing, is there anybody here who would like to take the stage?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun smiled gently and walked down from the stage before
            proceeding to sit down beside Murong Xuan.
          </p>
          <p>This scene made the crowd even more jealous.</p>
          <p>
            Despite that, this was Yang Xiyun’s private life. They were nobody
            to her, so it was best not to comment on anything.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>Chapter 519: Pretty Good I Guess, Aren’t You Too Puny</h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun sat beside Murong Xuan and kept exchanging whispers with
            him. The pair looked like a lovely couple.
          </p>
          <p>The remaining people felt envious upon seeing that.</p>
          <p>
            One after the other, they got up to the stage to showcase their
            respective guqin skills, hoping to draw Yang Xiyun’s attention and
            win her heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, this song named Mountain Heights has a really profound
            artistic conception.”
          </p>
          <p>“Guqin Master Lin’s skills have improved to another level.”</p>
          <p>
            A guqin master walked down from the stage and threw a glance at Yang
            Xiyun.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, she merely responded with a modest smile before turning
            over to continue her conversation with Murong Xuan.
          </p>
          <p>
            That guqin master felt really annoyed, but there was nothing he
            could do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not far away, Chu Kuangren, Shang Qingxue, and Feng Yaorao were
            seated at the same table.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Brother Chu, what are your thoughts on Guqin Master Lin’s
            performance?” Feng Yaorao broke the ice and asked. She just wanted
            to create an opening to chat with Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren, on the other hand, fell silent for a while after
            hearing her question. He then said, “I don’t know. Pretty good, I
            guess.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue, who was beside Chu Kuangren, was staring at his
            reaction when he said that. Noting how he fell silent for a while
            before responding, she could immediately tell that her Sect Leader
            did not even listen to the song earlier.
          </p>
          <p>In fact, the truth was not far away from that.</p>
          <p>
            From his perspective, except for Yang Xiyun’s opener at the
            beginning, the other people’s guqin skills were not even worth
            paying attention to.
          </p>
          <p>Theirs were too crude.</p>
          <p>
            He did not understand why these audiences were cheering and clapping
            for them. Were those kinds of guqin music even pleasant to the
            ears??
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, he understood that his skills were on a whole other
            level than these people, so he should not be judging them by his own
            standards. Thus, he did not lash out at his criticism but responded
            with a mere ‘pretty good’ remark. This was already the biggest
            tolerance that he could give.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, the tolerance that he perceived was just perfunctory in the
            eyes of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone at the table frowned, but they did not add on any comments.
          </p>
          <p>After that, another person went up the stage to perform.</p>
          <p>Once the song ended, the entire hall gave a round of applause.</p>
          <p>“Brother Chu, what about this one?” Feng Yaorao inquired again.</p>
          <p>“Pretty good, too.”</p>
          <p>‘Pretty good again??’</p>
          <p>‘D*mn, this guy is quite arrogant.’</p>
          <p>
            That was what everybody secretly thought, and they glared at Chu
            Kuangren with hostility.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Right, Daoist Li, why don’t you go up and perform a song too, as an
            eye-opener for everyone. What do you think?”
          </p>
          <p>Just then, one of the guqin masters suggested.</p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914dfd5ed68b00364a4a98",
                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>The crowd then turned their glances onto Li Changyin.</p>
          <p>Even Yang Xiyun did the same.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan followed suit too. As he looked toward Li Changyin, he
            immediately noticed Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue, whom he stared
            at wide-eyed.
          </p>
          <p>“Sect Leader!!”</p>
          <p>Murong Xuan exclaimed in shock.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren threw him a knowing glance. “You’ve finally noticed
            your Sect Leader.”
          </p>
          <p>Everybody looked toward both of them.</p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun’s eyes lit up also when she saw Chu Kuangren, and she
            turned to ask Murong Xuan. “Brother Murong, is this the Sect Leader
            you’ve always talked about?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun nodded slightly, then stood up and bowed toward Chu
            Kuangren. “Pleasure to meet you, Sect Leader Chu. My name’s Yang
            Xiyun.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She did not refer to him as Brother but Sect Leader. This show of
            respect felt a tad bit like she was meeting a parent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren returned her a gentle smile. “My pleasure, Lady Yang.”
          </p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, why are you here?” Murong Xuan asked curiously.</p>
          <p>“Well, long story.”</p>
          <p>
            “If that’s the case, please wait till the end of the banquet. We are
            here to enjoy the guqin festival, not to hear your stories.”
          </p>
          <p>A guqin master said discontentedly.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren and Murong Xuan stared at that person, but they did not
            say anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I shall go up and ridicule myself then.” Li Changyin smiled as he
            went up the stage and took out a guqin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information said that this guy was adept at multiple musical
            instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, no matter how skilled he was, there could only be one
            that he was best at. In this case, that was the guqin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Li Changyin flashed a warm smile at the audience, and with a gentle
            demeanor, he started plucking at the guqin strings with his fingers.
            With that, his performance began.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a moment, guqin music poured out and reverberated in the hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing this guqin music, the crowd could not help but feel
            mesmerized by it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even a guqin virtuoso like Yang Xiyun watched on in awe.
            n0𝑽𝐞𝑙𝓊𝚜𝔟.𝓬0𝑀
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the song had concluded, everybody was still deeply immersed in
            that melodious tune.
          </p>
          <p>“Amazing. Absolutely amazing!”</p>
          <p>
            “Daoist Li is truly remarkable. This song alone is enough to induct
            him into the musical world’s hall of fame.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “This song is much better than Lady Yang’s. It is even more profound
            in terms of artistic conception.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The people showered him with compliments as usual, and some gave
            more exaggerated responses than previously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Li Changyin was praised to the top of the world with this one song
            alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the side, Chu Kuangren was dumbfounded by the scene. Was it
            really that remarkable?
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            “Brother Chu, what do you think of the song?” Feng Yaorao asked.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s pretty good.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren admitted that Li Changyin’s guqin music was definitely
            far better than the others. Yet, from his point of view, it was just
            barely up to standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the others, his guqin music had not achieved a transcendent
            stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Pfft, and I thought he was some kind of elite guqin master. Turns
            out he’s just a music idiot who doesn’t know anything about rhythm.”
          </p>
          <p>A guqin master said with contempt in his eyes.</p>
          <p>
            The rest of the people agreed and felt that Chu Kuangren was someone
            who knew nothing about guqin Dao.
          </p>
          <p>Otherwise, why would his comment be the same for every song?</p>
          <p>
            “Daoist Li’s guqin skills are clearly more superb than the others,
            but he still gave the same comment. It is obvious by now that this
            guy has no musical sense at all, let alone guqin Dao.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Exactly. I bet he doesn’t even know how many strings there are on a
            guqin.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Forget it. He’s just a layman who doesn’t know any better. There’s
            no need to argue with him.”
          </p>
          <p>The audience laughed out loud and dropped the topic.</p>
          <p>
            They regarded themselves as professionals, so to discuss guqin
            skills with a layman would be insulting.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Brother Chu, are you not going up there to show them what you got?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Feng Yaorao, who was beside Chu Kuangren, prompted. She felt a
            little distasteful after seeing how the crowd was belittling Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            The others might not know, but as someone who had personally fought
            with him before, she knew.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren knew guqin Dao.</p>
          <p>
            Not only that, but he was an elite of guqin Dao. She could still
            vividly recall those Eight Celestial Demonic Chords.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Heh, forget it. Besides, I don’t have a guqin with me now.” Chu
            Kuangren shook his head and said.
          </p>
          <p>
            He looked incredibly calm, not heeding to whatever the others were
            saying.
          </p>
          <p>
            These people looked at him like a layman, while he looked back at
            them like ignorant fools.
          </p>
          <p>He would not be showcasing his guqin skills so cheaply.</p>
          <p>
            Not many in this world were worthy enough to listen to his guqin
            music.
          </p>
          <p>
            He would never go upstage to perform just because of some baseless
            criticism. He had better things to do than that.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, then.” Feng Yaorao conceded.</p>
          <p>
            However, at this time, the crowd redirected their glances to Murong
            Xuan.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems to me that you have a close relationship with Lady Yang,
            Brother Murong. I reckon you must have a certain degree of mastery
            in guqin Dao as well. Why don’t you show us some of that?”
          </p>
          <p>A white-robed guqin cultivator said.</p>
          <p>
            Compared with Chu Kuangren, Murong Xuan, the guy who stole Yang
            Xiyun’s heart, was more likely targeted by these people.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m afraid I’m not good at music.” Murong Xuan straight up told
            them the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Brother Murong, you’ve got to be kidding, right? Are you looking
            down on us, thinking that we don’t deserve to listen to your guqin
            music?”
          </p>
          <p>
            That white-robed guqin cultivator tweaked his tone at the end of his
            sentence. He sounded more aggressive.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you take offense in even that, I think you’re just too puny.”
          </p>
          <p>Just then, a cold voice was heard.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>
            Chapter 520: Murong Xuan’s Encounters, The Infinity Guqin Banquet
            Begins
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Once Chu Kuangren had spoken, that white-robed guqin master
            immediately felt intimidated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Li Changyin looked toward Chu Kuangren and said calmly, “Brother
            Chu, I think your comment is too unjust. We just wanted to admire
            Brother Murong’s guqin skills.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, even when he said he can’t, he must still oblige to your
            demands?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “We’re here at the guqin festival to share our guqin skills. If he
            doesn’t know how to, what is he even doing here?” the white-robed
            guqin master said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We can eat or sleep wherever we want. What’s in it for you to
            control what we do? Even the host, Lady Yang, has not said a single
            word. What makes you think you’ve earned the right to call the shots
            here?”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren stared at the white-robed guqin master.</p>
          <p>
            In that instant, the white-robed guqin master felt as if he was
            glared at by an archaic wild beast. An inexplicable coldness shot
            through his bones.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright, alright. These fellows are my friends. On my behalf, I
            wish everyone can bury the hatchet, shall we?”
          </p>
          <p>Yang Xiyun interfered.</p>
          <p>
            With that, all of them stopped arguing, and this conflict finally
            came to a rest.
          </p>
          <p>Very soon, the festival was approaching its end too.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s visit here this time could only be described with one
            word — disappointment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of so many guqin cultivators here, besides Yang Xiyun and Li
            Changyin, the rest of them were mere lowly, incapable people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even both Yang Xiyun and Li Changyin did not come close to matching
            his level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, Murong Xuan’s appearance was a pleasant surprise for
            him. The few of them gathered in a lounge and began to share their
            recent encounters.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Quick, spill the tea. How the hell did you get on with someone like
            Yang Xiyun?” Chu Kuangren’s eyes gleamed brightly. The gossip trait
            in him was ignited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan’s face blushed slightly when he heard that. “Sect
            Leader, Lady Yang and I are innocent.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Innocent? Both of you kept stealing glances at each other in front
            of the public. How am I supposed to buy what you just said?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ahem. Is it really that obvious?”</p>
          <p>
            “Are you for real, kid? I can’t believe you have the audacity to ask
            that. Both of you almost had the words ‘in love’ written on top of
            your foreheads. You’re telling me that it’s not obvious?”
            n0𝒱𝓮𝓵𝑢𝑠𝐛.𝒸0𝐦
          </p>
          <p>“Actually, what happened was...”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue listened intently.</p>
          <p>
            As it turned out, when Murong Xuan first entered the Emperor Road,
            he was teleported by the spatial energy into a forest.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            There were a lot of beasts inside the forest, and Murong Xuan could
            not find his way out even after several days. That was when he met
            Yang Xiyun, who happened to be there for her cultivation journey.
            When she was attacked by the beasts, Murong Xuan was the one who
            helped save her, after which they spent a significant amount of time
            together inside the forest...
          </p>
          <p>
            A flame sparked between the two of them during that period, and
            since Murong Xuan was still new to this place, he followed Yang
            Xiyun back to Melodious Void Sect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their story continued until today when they met Chu Kuangren and
            Shang Qingxue.
          </p>
          <p>
            After he finished the story, Chu Kuangren was rather disappointed.
            “That’s all??”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Um, yes. What else were you expecting, Sect Leader?” Murong Xuan
            replied in annoyance.
          </p>
          <p>
            “D*mn you, kid. Fortune has really smiled upon you, for you to have
            met such an innocent girl. You’ve managed to win her heart with such
            a cliché act of a hero saving a damsel in distress.”
          </p>
          <p>Murong Xuan blushed.</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren was just poking fun at him.</p>
          <p>Just then, some knocks were heard from the front door.</p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun walked in and smiled at them gently. “Brother Murong, why
            don’t we invite Sect Leader Chu and Sister Shang back to Melodious
            Void Sect?”
          </p>
          <p>Murong Xuan glanced at Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue.</p>
          <p>“If you don’t mind, we’ll tag along.” Chu Kuangren smiled back.</p>
          <p>“No worries.”</p>
          <p>
            Under Yang Xiyun’s invitation, Chu Kuangren and Shang Qingxue
            arrived at Melodious Void Sect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Melodious Void Sect Master welcomed Chu Kuangen and his companion
            in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Melodious Void Sect Master was a middle-aged woman. She had a
            few faint crow’s feet at the edge of her eyebrows, giving her a
            somewhat mature charm.
          </p>
          <p>
            After being told that Chu Kuangren was Murong Xuan’s Sect Leader,
            her attitude seemed a little cold. She merely arranged for her
            people to allocate two empty rooms for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sect Leader, the Melodious Void Sect Master may not have said it
            explicitly, but it feels like she doesn’t enjoy our company here.”
            Shang Qingxue remarked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think her problem is not with us, but with Murong Xuan. Just
            think about it. She has painstakingly brought up a disciple like
            Yang Xiyun, only for her to be drawn away by some random outsider.
            Do you think she would be fine with that?” Chu Kuangren smiled in
            response.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that really the case?”</p>
          <p>
            “I do hope that I’m right. Otherwise, Murong Xuan could really be in
            deep trouble.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Time passed by in a flash. Soon, it was already time for the
            Infinity Guqin Banquet to begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Infinity Guqin Banquet was held at a spacious square in the
            middle of Seven Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this day, the scene at the square was buzzing, with countless
            guqin cultivators looking forward to the event.
          </p>
          <p>Everybody was waiting for the Emperor Weapon to show itself.</p>
          <p>These people were mostly guqin cultivators.</p>
          <p>
            Among the crowd were Li Changyin, Yang Xiyun, Ji Xiaoyao, and a few
            young outstanding talents of Seven Chord City.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Suddenly, three figures dashed in from a distance away, landing at
            the very middle of the square.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the three presidents of the Seven Chord Guqin Association.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Melodious Void Sect Master, Phantasmic Melody Sect Master, and Ji
            Clan Leader. These three are not only the household names of the
            musical world but also renowned top-notch elites on Emperor Road. I
            think only they are qualified to host this Infinity Guqin Banquet.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “After all, the Emperor Weapon will select its owner today. Surely
            there must be a few powerhouses as hosts here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            All the guqin cultivators were engaged in their own discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the three presidents swept their gazes over every single
            person in the crowd.
          </p>
          <p>
            They wanted to see if there were any guqin elites there that were
            worth noting.
          </p>
          <p>“Guqin Sage Beihai is here too.”</p>
          <p>
            “Not just him, but Master Daoist Liuli, who has been living in
            isolation in the Lapis Lazuli Mountain for so many years is also
            here.”
          </p>
          <p>Just then, a sword ray swooped down from the sky above.</p>
          <p>
            The sword ray landed at the square, and a gush of sword qi swept
            across the whole area like a hurricane. A handsome young man was
            seen slowly stepping through the air, toward the square.
          </p>
          <p>
            This man arrived in front of the sword ray and pulled out his
            longsword. Strapped behind his back was a black guqin.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Such appearance, this must be Sword Tribe’s sky pride, Jian
            Changfeng, who is regarded as a master of both sword and guqin.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I didn’t expect even the Sword Tribe people would join in the
            Infinity Guqin Banquet.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think almost all cultivators who are skilled in guqin Dao are
            here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng was one of the top sky-prides among Emperor Road’s
            younger generation, and his power was weaker than only outlawed
            sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rumor had it he was so strong that he could hold a steady ground
            even when battling a Boundary Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Jian Changfeng arrived, many other sky-prides who were experts
            at guqin Dao appeared as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each one of them was a big name themselves. Seeing these people, the
            normal guqin cultivators begin to feel double the pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            With their skill level, hoping to gain the Emperor Weapon from these
            people would be like building castles in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Forget it. I don’t have any high hopes of succeeding here anyway.
            I’ll just take it as an experience.”
          </p>
          <p>Some of the guqin cultivators started consoling themselves.</p>
          <p>
            When Ji Clan Leader, one of the three honorable presidents, saw that
            the crowd was complete, he stroked his goatee and announced, “Lo and
            behold, the Emperor Weapon!”
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, dark ominous clouds of grotesque shapes amassed atop the
            sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amongst the clouds, a flash of azure blue lightning dazzled
            frenziedly, emitting an incredibly powerful domineering aura.
          </p>
          <p>Immediately following that, a bolt of lightning struck down!</p>
          <p>
            After the lightning rays dissipated, what met the crowd’s eyes was
            an entirely azure, almost crystal-like, resplendent guqin!
          </p>
          <p>
            This guqin was the Emperor Weapon that so many cultivators yearned
            for!
          </p>
          <p>“This guqin is called... Springtime Lightning!!”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>
            Chapter 521: The Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning, The Guqin
            Demon And Art Ghoul, No One Formidable In Guqin Throughout This
            Generation
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            A jolt of lightning suddenly struck down from the sky and turned
            into a blue guqin that had a crystal-like surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were seven strings on it, which radiated brilliantly. It
            looked extraordinary.
          </p>
          <p>“This guqin is known as the... Springtime Lightning!”</p>
          <p>The Emperor Weapon, Springtime Lightning!</p>
          <p>
            Following the Ji Clan Leader’s announcement, the coveting gazes of
            every guqin cultivator landed onto that guqin with desire burning in
            their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>“So this is the Emperor Weapon. It’s truly remarkable.”</p>
          <p>
            “Rumor has it that when this guqin emerged, dark clouds shadowed the
            sky and cackles of lightning incessantly for three days straight. Is
            this how it got the name, Springtime Lightning?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Springtime Lightning. Lightning that strikes down during the spring
            season is usually majestic and can also serve to symbolize the birth
            of all things.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The guqin cultivators stared at the Springtime Lightning. They
            wanted so badly to go ahead and touch it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, because the three presidents of the Seven Chord Guqin
            Association were there, no one dared to make a move like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Now that the Emperor Weapon has appeared, it is the time for all of
            you to display your skills and win the Emperor Weapon’s
            acknowledgment. Please, go ahead.”
          </p>
          <p>The Phantasmic Melody Sect Master said.</p>
          <p>
            The three presidents of the association had already attempted this
            before, but none of them had gotten this Emperor Weapon’s
            acknowledgment.
          </p>
          <p>
            They even started a fight over the ownership of this Emperor Weapon.
            That was why the Great Guqin Banquet was organized. It was to allow
            the Emperor Weapon, Springtime Lightning to choose a master on its
            own.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Seeing that we need to gain the acknowledgment of a Guqin Dao
            Emperor Weapon, I suppose we’ll need to display a level of guqin
            cultivation that is on par with it. I shall have a go then.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A white-robed guqin master stepped out and took out a guqin. With
            his fingers plucking on the guqin, he sped through a few melodies,
            hoping to gain the acknowledgment of the Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no matter how many songs he played, the Emperor Weapon
            Springtime Lightning had no reaction at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not wishing to give up, the white-robed guqin master’s fingers
            continued plucking and playing the guqin frantically until his
            fingers were cut. Even so, he was oblivious to it, and he looked
            increasingly like a madman the more he played.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Guqin Dao Emperor Weapon was just too rare, making it a priceless
            treasure to any cultivators specializing in guqin Dao.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a treasure like that right before the white-robed guqin
            master’s eyes, how could he possibly give up the chance to obtain
            it?
          </p>
          <p>
            “That level of guqin cultivation you have is never going to be
            enough.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At this moment, Jian Changfeng of the Sword Tribe commented. He
            raised his hand and unleashed a great burst of spiritual power,
            immediately sending that white-robed guqin master flying.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the white-robed guqin master tried to get up and fight back
            after crashing on the ground, he felt a chilling sword intent lock
            on to him. It felt as if a cold bucket of water had been poured all
            over him, causing him to return to his senses. He no longer dared to
            make any move as he looked at Jian Changfeng of the Sword Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, he glanced at the Springtime Lightning, knowing that Emperor
            Weapon and he were not meant to be.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">

                unit: "63914dfd5ed68b00364a4a98",
                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Jian Changfang ignored the white-robed guqin master and looked at
            the Springtime Lightning in front of him. He said, “This Emperor
            Weapon has appeared for me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Following that, he took out the black guqin he had on his back,
            placed it on his lap, and started to play it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Known to be a master in both the art of guqin music and
            swordsmanship, his guqin music was filled with a razor-sharp aura,
            like his sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            Waves of guqin music reverberated with sounds of metal clanging.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was as if there were thousands of infantry and horses clashing
            and charging before everyone.
          </p>
          <p>“What splendid guqin music! Such refined skill!”</p>
          <p>Some of the guqin masters could not help but praise.</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked towards the Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning. All
            they saw was a light tremble, but there was no movement from it
            after that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jina Changfeng frowned slightly, not expecting that the Emperor
            Weapon would not acknowledge him despite all he did.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is undoubtedly an Emperor Weapon. However, you must be mine
            today!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng snorted coldly and immediately plucked his fingers on
            the strings, raising his guqin music Daoist Rhyme to a higher level.
          </p>
          <p>“Let us all give it a go, then.”</p>
          <p>
            “If we go at it one by one, who knows when our turn will arrive.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “If we want to get the Emperor Weapon’s acknowledgment, we must do
            our best with our abilities!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowd of guqin cultivators could not wait any longer as everyone
            took out their guqins and started playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other guqin cultivators like Li Changyin, Yang Xiyun, and Ji Xiaoyao
            did the same as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, the entire square was filled with countless melodies
            of guqin music reverberating, and the sky was emanating with various
            Daoist Rhymes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thousands of guqin music sounded as thousands of guqin strings were
            plucked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every guqin cultivator was unleashing their style of guqin music
            Daoist Rhyme, attempting to gain a reaction from the Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several surges of guqin music stood out amongst the sea of music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides Jian Changfeng’s guqin music, the sky-prides from the Seven
            Chord City like Li Changyin stood out a little more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among them, Li Changyin’s guqin music sounded slightly
            hallucinatory, as if it was the ethereal clouds that were high up in
            the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyin of the Melodious Void Sect was remarkable as well.
            Compared to the sentimental melody she played at the Cloudveil
            Pavilion a few days ago, the song she played today was wonderful.
            Her music was profound and boundless, like a never-ending landscape
            that was slowly unfolding itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, Ji Xiaoyao’s guqin music was extremely firm and
            powerful despite her petite figure. It felt as if she had used all
            her strength to play every single note, which unleashed a majestic
            presence. This was the famed song that had been passed down through
            generations in the Ji clan, the Limitless Song.
          </p>
          <p>
            The guqin music from these few people overpowered most of the guqin
            cultivators’ guqin music.
          </p>
          <p>
            This even made some of the guqin masters mess up their tempo, and
            they did not know how to continue playing after that.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how the guqin cultivators tried, their music did not
            resonate with the Emperor Weapon, let alone get it to acknowledge
            them as its master.
          </p>

          <p>
            “D*mn it. It really is difficult to obtain the Emperor Weapon’s
            acknowledgment.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “We have already done our best to play the best songs we could in
            our arsenal, yet it was to no avail?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just when everyone was almost exhausted in their attempts to gain
            the Emperor Weapon acknowledgment, a burst of laughter suddenly rang
            from amidst the clouds.
          </p>
          <p>“Haha...”</p>
          <p>
            That exhilarating laughter contained an extremely strong spiritual
            power as echoed in the clouds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The guqin music that filled the whole square was instantly
            suppressed by that laughter!
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems that there’s no formidable guqin Dao cultivator in this
            generation. I can’t believe no one can obtain the Emperor Weapon’s
            acknowledgment.”
          </p>
          <p>Two people stepped down from the clouds.</p>
          <p>It was two elderly men.</p>
          <p>
            One of them had a guqin on his back, while the other had a large
            drawing brush on his back. They were both emanating a surge of
            powerful Boundary Emperor’s Aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guqin Association’s three presidents were shocked to see the two
            people.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s them! The Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul!”</p>
          <p>“Why are those two here?”</p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul were legendary names in the Emperor Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among those two, one chose their path of Dao through the guqin,
            while the other delved within the Dao through art. Both of them were
            top-notched beings in the Boundary Emperor realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, those two did not have a good reputation in the Emperor
            Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon liked to collect famous guqins. Whenever he had his eyes
            on a well-known guqin, he must definitely obtain it for himself,
            regardless of whether the guqin had an owner or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Art Ghoul was more or less the same, with the only difference being
            that he liked collecting famous paintings and art all over the world
            to remake copies instead. After copying, he would always destroy the
            original and intentionally spread his copies throughout the world.
            Due to his superb drawing skills, only a few could see through its
            authenticity.
          </p>
          <p>
            He relished the feeling of toying with artists and painters all over
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, if anyone managed to see through his fakery, he would
            immediately seek them out and kill them.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was why no one dared to point out that Art Ghoul’s painting was
            a copy even if it could recognize its forgery. n0𝑽𝖊𝐿𝐮𝑆𝓫.𝐜0𝚖
          </p>
          <p>
            This gave both Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul a bad reputation in the
            Emperor Road. One could say that their reputation was infamous
            instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, no one could do anything about it because they were both
            incredibly powerful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, the two of them seemed to have gone into hiding, and they had
            not appeared in the past thousand years.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the appearance of the Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning
            that attracted both of their appearances again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems that this generation really has no one formidable in guqin
            Dao. Since no one can obtain this Emperor Weapon’s acknowledgment,
            then I shall help myself to it then.”
          </p>
          <p>The one that spoke was the Guqin Demon.</p>
          <p>
            His black hair swayed in the air as he took out a black guqin that
            emanated a creepy and gloomy aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was the Guqin Demon’s most treasured item in his collection,
            the Yin Demon Guqin.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Chapter 522: Guqin Demon Snatches The Emperor Weapon By Force,
            Thousand Guqin Welcoming Him, Sorry For Being Late
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The moment the Yin Demon Guqin appeared, a dark and chilling surge
            of Daoist Rhyme immediately spread out. Suddenly, the surrounding
            temperature dropped to the freezing point.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, the guqin cultivators’ guqins were especially enveloped in
            a strange chill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the guqin cultivators’ fingers were also eroded by the
            chill, and they could not help themselves but fling their guqins
            away. They all looked at Guqin Demon and his guqin with horror.
          </p>
          <p>“What kind of guqin is that? Why is it so weird and creepy?!”</p>
          <p>“There’s something strange about that guqin!”</p>
          <p>
            Only Li Changyin and some other sky-prides were able to resist that
            chill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, even they could not help but look at Guqin Demon with
            fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So this is Guqin Demon. Is that the rumored Yin Demon Guqin in his
            grasp? It’s truly extraordinary indeed.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s really scary.”</p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon’s cold gaze swept across everyone as he sneered. “So
            this is the best the world of guqin has to offer in this generation?
            Besides a handful of people, the rest of you are all useless trash!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowd of guqin cultivators was slightly annoyed to hear what he
            said.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, they could only bear it because of Guqin Demon’s strength.
            None was daring to show any sign of dissatisfaction at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The disdain in Guqin Demon’s eyes became stronger when he saw
            everyone’s attitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Guqin Demon, why exactly are you here?” The Ji Clan Leader
            questioned loudly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, to get this Emperor Weapon to recognize its new master, of
            course.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon grinned. He then looked at the Springtime Lightning and
            laughed. “For all these years, this is my first time coming across a
            Guqin Dao Emperor Weapon. How can I miss the opportunity to get such
            a wonderful guqin?!”
          </p>
          <p>“You are not welcomed here!”</p>
          <p>The Phantasmic Melody Sect Master uttered coldly.</p>
          <p>
            No guqin cultivator could possibly be fond of someone like Guqin
            Demon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the Seven Chord City was a hotspot for countless guqin
            cultivators, Guqin Demon’s presence was even more unwelcomed here.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Since all of you can’t obtain the Emperor Weapon’s acknowledgment,
            why don’t I try? So what if you guys don’t welcome me? Do I look
            like I care about something trivial like that?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Brother Guqin Demon, just take your time and do what you need to
            do. You can leave them to me.”
          </p>
          <p>Art Ghoul said with a smile.</p>
          <p>
            He looked at the Ji Clan Leader and others with some slight disdain
            in his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, he took out the gigantic brush on his back and made a
            light stroke with it. A huge ink mark soon appeared in the void.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ink mark spread out to form a scenery of mountains and rivers
            that spanned dozens of kilometers wide, dragging the Ji Clan Leader
            and two other Presidents into the world within that painting.
          </p>
          <p>“Everyone, be careful.”</p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, bring it on. Let’s see what the rumored Art Ghoul has in
            store for us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as the three Boundary Emperors began to deal with Art Ghoul,
            Guqin Demon had already made his move.

          <p>
            Looking at the Springtime Lightning before him, Guqin Demon’s
            fingers immediately started dancing rapidly on the Yin Demon Guqin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Waves upon waves of creepy guqin music resounded, spreading as far
            as a kilometer away!
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing this sound, countless living beings held their heads
            and howled in pain as they felt like it was going to explode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even sky-prides like Li Changyin had no choice but to channel their
            spiritual power to resist the creepy guqin music.
          </p>
          <p>Clang... Clang... Clang...</p>
          <p>
            The dark and chilling guqin music reverberated through the void.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Springtime Lightning nearby seemed to have felt the guqin music
            as well, and it started to tremble.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, that’s right. Just like that.”</p>
          <p>
            “Submit to my power, dear Springtime Lightning, for I am the sole
            master who can unleash your full potential!”
          </p>
          <p>Guqin Demon’s eyes were filled with a burning passion.</p>
          <p>
            Just as he said, he had collected so many famous guqins over the
            years that there was no way he would give up the chance to obtain a
            Guqin Dao Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had even started to imagine himself wiping entire battlefields
            with that Emperor Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If this goes on, the Springtime Lightning will truly fall into
            Guqin Demon’s hands.”
          </p>
          <p>Li Changyin and the others looked very grim at this sight.</p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, if you want that Emperor Weapon, you’ll have to go through me
            first!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng suddenly let out a low cry as he unsheathed his sword
            and struck it out across the void.
          </p>
          <p>A terrifying surge of sword qi poured out.</p>
          <p>“Hmph, out of the way, little one!”</p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon snorted coldly and plucked one of the strings on his
            guqin, where a powerful surge of guqin music Daoist Rhyme erupted.
            It instantly shattered the incoming sword qi attack and sent Jian
            Changfeng flying hundreds of meters away.
          </p>
          <p>“He’s strong!”</p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng was shocked. n0𝗏𝖊𝓵𝗎𝓈𝒷.𝓒0𝗆</p>
          <p>
            If that single wave of guqin music was already unbearable, his
            opponent’s strength must be much more powerful than his.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If it weren’t for the sake of the Sword Tribe, that wave of guqin
            music would’ve killed you by now.”
          </p>
          <p>Guqin Demon uttered coldly.</p>
          <p>
            The others could not help but lament in silence. Coming from an
            influential background was indeed beneficial.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it were someone else facing that attack just now, they would have
            been killed by the guqin music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon’s power greatly shocked everyone present at the scene,
            and no one dared to interfere with him anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems like this Springtime Lightning doesn’t belong to us after
            all.”
          </p>
          <p>Li Changyin had a slightly unpleasant look on his face.</p>
          <p>
            “Guqin Demon is an extremely cruel and violent person. If he managed
            to obtain this Emperor Weapon today, there’s no telling what havoc
            he might wreak upon the common folk.”
          </p>
          <p>Concern flashed in Yang Xiyun’s eyes.</p>
          <p>
            She then looked towards the Ji Clan Leader and others who were
            battling Art Ghoul.

          <p>
            Art Ghoul was also incredibly powerful as he could still hold his
            own despite fighting three Boundary Emperors. In the world within
            his painting, ten million horrifying ghouls were wailing, depicting
            a terrifying scene from hell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the three great Boundary Emperors had no problem battling
            him, they could not break free from the world within the painting
            for quite some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Guqin Demon managed to obtain the Springtime Lightning Emperor
            Weapon by then, no one would ever be able to stop the both of them
            after that.
          </p>
          <p>Hum...</p>
          <p>
            At this time, a frightening surge of Emperor’s Aura erupted from the
            Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning. Within thunder-like clang,
            terrifying sound waves spread outward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon was sent flying several hundred meters by that powerful
            surge of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            After blasting Guqin Demon away, the Springtime Lightning returned
            to its usual calm once again.
          </p>
          <p>Everyone was extremely shocked to witness that scene.</p>
          <p>
            This was especially true for Guqin Demon, whose expression had
            turned very ugly by that point.
          </p>
          <p>“You rejected me. Did you just reject me?!”</p>
          <p>
            “In this world, who else could possibly deserve you besides me,
            Guqin Demon?!”
          </p>
          <p>Guqin Demon roared at the Springtime Lightning.</p>
          <p>
            Everyone else looked at each other, surprised that even Guqin Demon
            could not obtain the Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning’s
            acknowledgment.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how rotten Guqin Demon’s character or personality was, his
            level of cultivation in guqin music was unquestionable.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he were to be ranked second in guqin Dao proficiency, no one
            would dare to claim first.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Since you chose to not acknowledge me, then no one shall ever hope
            to obtain you!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon rushed towards the Springtime Lightning with crazy eyes.
          </p>
          <p>He wanted to obtain the Springtime Lightning by force.</p>
          <p>
            Even if he could not gain its approval, he would hide it away so
            that no one else could.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seemingly figuring out Guqin Demon’s intention, a jolt of lightning
            shot out from the Springtime Lightning’s blue body. It formed an air
            barrier that blocked Guqin Demon from getting to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as Guqin Demon’s hand collided with the lightning, a boom
            resounded in the void.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite how powerful the Springtime Lightning was, it still could
            not unleash its full power as it lacked a master.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon’s hands continued to break through the lightning,
            reaching towards the Springtime Lightning.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, at that moment, the sound of guqin music suddenly rang out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone froze. ‘Who dares to play the guqin at a time like this?!’
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, that’s not right. That sound didn’t come from just one guqin
            alone.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, everyone noticed something that shocked them beyond
            their words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every single guqin in their surroundings was seen playing on their
            own, and multiple melodies sounded at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
          <p>Li Changyin looked at his own guqin with surprise.</p>
          <p>“Look. It’s him!!”</p>
          <p>Everyone shifted their gazes into the near distance.</p>
          <p>
            All they saw was a white-robed young man with black hair approaching
            them. He had an immeasurably vast and mysterious guqin music Daoist
            Rhyme emanating from his body. Wherever it went, it seemed like
            there was an invisible hand playing countless guqins in the
            surroundings. The guqin music it made sounded as if they were
            welcoming a supreme guqin master!!
          </p>
          <p>Thousands of guqin welcomed him!!</p>
          <p>
            “Sorry for being late.” Chu Kuangren looked at the Springtime
            Lightning nearby and chuckled. He spoke as if it was something that
            already belonged to him.

            Chapter 523: The Overworld String, Guqin Demon And Art Ghoul’s
            Combination Technique, Guqin, Come
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren arrived at the Infinity Guqin Banquet with an
            incredibly mysterious guqin music Daoist Rhyme emanating from him.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, thousands of guqin at the scene were welcoming his
            presence!
          </p>
          <p>Everyone looked indescribably shocked to witness that scene.</p>
          <p>It was as if that person was the god of guqin himself.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, how could a phenomenon like that even happen?</p>
          <p>“It’s him. How could it possibly be him?!”</p>
          <p>Li Changyin’s expression suddenly changed.</p>
          <p>
            Not only him but many people around him had also recognized the
            person as Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            This person had shown up at the Cloudveil Pavilion a few days ago.
            Yet during that time, everyone thought he knew nothing about guqin
            Dao.
          </p>
          <p>As such, the scene before them was like a slap on their face.</p>
          <p>
            If he could make something like this happen with absolutely no
            knowledge of guqin Dao, then what would that say about the rest of
            them?
          </p>
          <p>“I can’t believe what Brother Murong said was true.”</p>
          <p>Yang Xiyun looked at Chu Kuangren’s figure with amazement.</p>
          <p>
            She suddenly recalled Murong Xuan telling her that his Sect Leader
            also knew how to play the guqin. He even said that his Sect Leader
            could play it better than her, which caused them to have quite a
            squabble over it.
          </p>
          <p>She had forgotten about that later on.</p>
          <p>
            However, she knew now that Murong Xuan was not lying to her at all.
            The Black Heaven Sect Leader was indeed a master in guqin Dao!
          </p>
          <p>“Who the h*ll are you, young man?”</p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon stopped playing when he noticed Chu Kuangren’s sudden
            appearance and looked sternly at the latter.
          </p>
          <p>
            His keen sense told him that the guqin music Daoist Rhyme from this
            person before him was just too extraordinary.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m its master.” Chu Kuangren pointed at the Springtime Lightning
            and chuckled.
          </p>
          <p>“Bullsh*t!”</p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon snorted. The Springtime Lightning had never acknowledged
            anyone as its master since it appeared, so how could it even have
            one in the first place?
          </p>
          <p>
            Without another word, Guqin Demon held the Yin Demon Guqin and faced
            Chu Kuangren, to whom he said in a chilling tone, “I don’t care who
            you are, but those that get in my way of obtaining this guqin shall
            die!”
          </p>
          <p>
            He then pressed his five fingers onto the Yin Demon Guqin and
            strummed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Violent and frantic guqin music rang out, sounding like a group of
            barbaric demons dancing wildly. It was filled with darkness and
            terror.
          </p>
          <p>
            The surrounding void continuously erupted amid the guqin music. The
            attack was extremely horrifying.
          </p>
          <p>
            This gave Li Changyin, Yang Xiyun, and the others no choice but to
            step back for fear that they would be caught up in the guqin sound
            waves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren merely stood still. As soon as the guqin
            music attack neared him, it was stopped by an invisible surge of
            mind power.
          </p>

              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

                unit: "63914dfd5ed68b00364a4a98",
                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>“Your guqin music is quite... noisy!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren uttered before he lightly stroked the void with his
            finger.
          </p>
          <p>
            An invisible thread appeared out of thin air, and it was surrounded
            by surges of guqin music Daoist Rhyme.
          </p>
          <p>It was a... Guqin String!</p>
          <p>He could shape his own qi into a string!</p>
          <p>“The Overworld String!!”</p>
          <p>The surrounding guqin cultivators were stunned.</p>
          <p>
            The Overworld String was the highest realm one could reach in guqin
            Dao.
          </p>
          <p>
            One may not have a physical string, but as long as Daoist Rhymes
            were present, anything in the world, such as a strand of hair, could
            be made into a guqin string.
          </p>
          <p>
            The guqin cultivators did not expect Chu Kuangren’s level of mastery
            in guqin Dao to have reached such a level!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even Guqin Demon was shocked to see this. After all, even someone
            like him still had a long way to get to the realm of The Overworld
            String.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, the person before him could do it so effortlessly!</p>
          <p>This was truly unbelievable.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s been a while since I’ve used guqin Dao in combat. You’re lucky
            to be able to witness this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren chuckled as his fingers plucked onto the qi string that
            was formed within the void, unleashing a terrifying wave of guqin
            music Daoist Rhyme. “Third movement of the Eight Celestial Demonic
            Chords, Profound Carillon Resonance!”
          </p>
          <p>With a pluck of the string, guqin music resounded in the air!</p>
          <p>
            The guqin music sounded as if it passed through from the archaic
            ancient times. It carried an ever-changing, simple, and dense aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a blast, that simple guqin music instantly shattered Guqin
            Demon’s chaotic guqin music and subsequently slammed into his body
            with a majestic poise!
          </p>
          <p>A streak of blood spurted out.</p>
          <p>
            As Guqin Demon was sent flying several meters away, he looked at Chu
            Kuangren with an indescribable shock in his eyes. “Such guqin
            music... That’s impossible!” n0𝐯𝖾𝓵𝓊𝔰𝒷.𝑐0𝑚
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the Ji Clan Leaders and others who were battling Art
            Ghoul had also stopped.
          </p>
          <p>They were all shocked by what Chu Kuangren did as well.</p>
          <p>
            Art Ghoul’s expression changed. He immediately dispersed the
            surrounding Daoist Rhyme and dashed to Guqin Demon’s side. “Brother
            Guqin Demon, are you alright?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon wiped the blood away from his mouth. “I’m fine, but this
            guy... His proficiency in guqin music is extremely profound. I’m
            afraid I alone am not a match for him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don’t worry. If we take him on together, I bet we can defeat him
            without trouble.”
          </p>
          <p>“Very well!” Guqin Demon nodded.</p>
          <p>
            Then, Art Ghoul waved his gigantic brush and drew a stroke into the
            void. As if a large bucket of ink was poured into the void, huge
            amounts of ink started to stain its surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>The sky seemed to have transformed into a painting.</p>
          <p>
            However, it was not a painting of gorgeous flowers, or magnificent
            mountains and rivers, or dazzling beauties that were dancing
            gracefully....
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a scene from hell with countless ghouls and ghosts instead!
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the painting, numerous ink-formed ferocious ghosts rushed
            towards to attack Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">

            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            In the meantime, Guqin Demon sat with his legs crossed and strummed
            the Yin Demon Guqin. A chaotic and dark tune suddenly reverberated
            through the realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accompanied by the wailing of the thousands of ghosts, the might of
            the dark tune became stronger!
          </p>
          <p>
            An incredibly horrifying Daoist Rhyme filled the whole area, turning
            it into an apocalyptic scene that echoed with chaotic demonic music!
          </p>
          <p>“What terrifying power.”</p>
          <p>
            “I can’t believe Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul can unleash such scary
            combat strength when they join hands!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “By the heavens, the power of those two is just too horrifying!”
          </p>
          <p>
            All the younger cultivators were stunned by the magnitude of Guqin
            Demon and Art Ghoul’s power.
          </p>
          <p>Such power was just too overpowering.</p>
          <p>
            Even Boundary Emperors like the Ji Clan Leader and others were
            fearful of it.
          </p>
          <p>“This level of power is approaching that of a Sovereign?!”</p>
          <p>The Ji Clan Leader gulped and said.</p>
          <p>
            A Sovereign did not refer to a realm of power. It was a term to
            describe beings more powerful than Boundary Emperors but possessed
            combat strength weaker than an Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the whole of Emperor Road, only a handful of people possessed the
            combat strength of a Sovereign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of them formed the mid-level support for their respective
            archaic ancient orthodoxies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul could unleash a power that was close
            to a Sovereign, it was no wonder they had the guts to come to the
            Seven Chord City for the Springtime Lightning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although their combined power might not be able to feat the joint
            forces of several past ancient orthodoxies, no one would be able to
            stop them from escaping if they wished to.
          </p>
          <p>“Merging guqin and art as one? That’s interesting.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren grinned as he felt a horrifying pressure coming from
            all directions. At that moment, he sensed a threat.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the ghosts rushed to attack him, surges of sword qi were
            unleashed from his body, tearing them all apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the number of ghosts that Art Ghoul could create with his
            spiritual power as ink seemed infinite.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coupled with Guqin Demon’s guqin music, which became increasingly
            chaotic, it was about to reach a higher level.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Boy, this Demonic Ghoulish Art Melody is a technique that took both
            of us thousands of years in hiding to develop. You should consider
            yourself lucky for having the honor to witness it first!”
          </p>
          <p>The Art Ghoul uttered coldly as he held the gigantic brush.</p>
          <p>
            Only then did everyone realize the reason why the Art Ghoul and
            Guqin Demon had disappeared for so many years. It turned out that
            they were busy developing a technique to combine guqin music and
            art.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was no doubt that the results of their research were very
            fruitful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin and art — two different types of Daoist Rhyme, two different
            types of skills, and two different surges of energy had combined to
            form a completely new and shocking power!
          </p>
          <p>
            That was the highest level of coordination between two Boundary
            Emperors!
          </p>
          <p>It was also one of the rarest sights in this world.</p>
          <p>
            However, there was no sign of panic on Chu Kuangren’s face despite
            such a menacing sight and overbearing power before him. His gaze was
            as calm as usual.
          </p>
          <p>His eyes were like a calm and bottomless pond.</p>
          <p>
            “You both should be honored instead because you’re about to hear the
            most wonderful song in this world!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It is a guqin music meant for the Celestial Demons themselves, the
            real sound of the world’s nature!”
          </p>
          <p>
            An incredibly terrifying guqin music Daoist Rhyme erupted from Chu
            Kuangren’s body as he coldly commanded. “Guqin, come!!”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">

          <p></p>
          <p>“Guqin, come to me!!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren shouted, and coupled with the guqin music Daoist Rhyme
            that was surging on his body, the Emperor Weapon Springtime
            Lightning suddenly began to react.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Springtime Lightning, which none of the guqin cultivators could
            resonate with no matter how hard they tried, trembled violently.
          </p>
          <p>
            An overpowering surge of guqin music Daoist Rhyme and Emperor’s Aura
            erupted before it resonated with Chu Kuangren’s guqin music Daoist
            Rhyme. Everyone was stunned.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning then turned into a blue bolt
            of lightning and disappeared on the spot, heading towards Chu
            Kuangren at breakneck speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a blink of an eye, the Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning broke
            through Art Ghoul’s painting world as it flew towards Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>Thousands of ghouls were wiped out wherever it went!</p>
          <p>
            The bolt of lightning stopped in front of Chu Kuangren, where it
            reverted to the Springtime Lightning’s form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its crystal blue body was carved with gorgeous patterns, and it had
            an extraordinary Daoist Rhyme...
          </p>
          <p>
            Every aspect demonstrated that this Emperor Weapon was no ordinary
            item.

            Despite its pride and arrogance as an Emperor Weapon, it levitated
            calmly before Chu Kuangren as if waiting for him to play it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren gently brushed his fingers across the Springtime
            Lightning’s body and murmured, “If you deem me as your master, I
            shall use you to play the most beautiful and grand music the world
            has ever heard!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Springtime Lightning trembled lightly as if it was responding to
            Chu Kuangren’s voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every guqin cultivator outside the world within the painting was
            stupefied.
          </p>
          <p>
            They could not even make the Springtime Lightning move despite
            giving their best effort. Yet, it straight up deemed Chu Kuangren as
            its master just because he commanded it to do so?!
          </p>
          <p>That power gap between them was just too big!!</p>
          <p>“How can such a skilled guqin master exist in this world!!”</p>
          <p>“Unbelievable. This is simply unbelievable!”</p>
          <p>
            This scene was just too shocking even for cultivators like the Ji
            Clan Leader and others who were at the peak of guqin Dao.
          </p>
          <p>
            They would not be so surprised if the Springtime Lightning had
            simply deemed someone as its master.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the way the Springtime Lightning acknowledged Chu Kuangren
            as its master was just too much for them to handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So what if you have the help of the Emperor Weapon? With Art Ghoul
            and my combined power, we’re undefeatable in this world!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon yelled. His behavior was starting to get a little crazed
            at that time, and his guqin music had become increasingly chaotic.
          </p>
          <p>It was the same with Art Ghoul as well.</p>
          <p>
            Using his spiritual power as ink, he kept on drawing out countless
            ferocious ghouls to attack Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren simply pressed his fingers on the Springtime
            Lightning’s string and said, “Have a taste of the Celestial Demonic
            Chords!”
          </p>
          <p>With a clang, guqin music echoed in the realm.</p>
          <p>
            First Movement of the Eight Celestial Demonic Chords, Boundless
            Overworld!
          </p>
          <p>
            Boundless and overbearing qi that contained the energy of the world
            began to attack everything in the world within the painting!
          </p>

          <p>Second Movement, Endless Torrential Gale!</p>
          <p>
            Guqin music turned into countless wind scythes, which built up into
            a terrifying hurricane that swept out in all directions and killed
            thousands of ghouls at once!
          </p>
          <p>Third Movement, Profound Carillon Resonance!</p>
          <p>
            A piece of simple guqin music emerged, blasting Guqin Demon backward
            once again!
          </p>
          <p>Fourth Movement, Assaulting Convergence!</p>
          <p>
            Guqin music surged in from all directions, attacking the painting
            world!
          </p>
          <p>
            Five Movement, Unending Voracious Vigor; Sixth Movement, Devastating
            Cyclone Barrage; Seventh Movement, Synchronous Overworld Anarchy...
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Seventh Movement played, the painting world started to give
            way under the multiple waves of guqin music Daoist Rhyme.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the heavens and earth within it trembled, the painting world
            immediately crumbled!
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the might of that terrifying power, Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul
            suffered a heavy blow.
          </p>
          <p>Even so, Chu Kuangren’s guqin music did not stop there.</p>
          <p>Sounds of guqin music continued to echo in the realm.</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, all eyes were on the figure who was playing the
            guqin. Nothing else was worth their attention more than this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was as if he and that guqin were the only things that remained in
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            As waves of guqin music Daoist Rhyme reverberated through the void,
            everyone could feel as if they had turned deaf as they could not
            hear anything.
          </p>
          <p>However, their souls were still trembling uncontrollably.</p>
          <p>
            The impact of Chu Kuangren’s guqin music had far exceeded the limits
            of their senses, and it was reaching into their souls instead!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Final Movement of the Eight Celestial Demonic Chords, Grand Melodic
            Void!” n0𝐕𝑒𝒍𝗎𝐒𝓫.𝒸0𝓶
          </p>
          <p>
            The final movement of the eight rang out and unleashed an
            indescribable surge of guqin music Daoist Rhyme, which poured out
            like an endless torrential wave!
          </p>
          <p>It was silent, but it shook the very heavens and earth!</p>
          <p>
            “Grand Melodic Void. It’s the Grand Melodic Void!! This is the real
            Grand Melodic Void!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Melodious Void Sect Master looked at Chu Kuangren with
            amazement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their sect was named the Melodious Void Sect because they adhered to
            the concept of the void and simplicity that formed the core of their
            melody.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no one in the Melodious Void Sect has ever achieved that
            level even until now. To her surprise, she was witnessing it from an
            outsider instead!
          </p>
          <p>
            With the Grand Melodic Void playing, overbearing and endless surges
            of guqin music Daoist Rhyme instantly erupted onto both Guqin Demon
            and Art Ghoul.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two top-notched Boundary Emperors could no longer resist the
            might of that attack and were injured to the brink of death.
          </p>
          <p>
            By then, their Boundary Emperor physique had already been damaged to
            the point of no return.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of them were lying on the ground, their brush and guqin strings
            broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The music of the Celestial Demons. This is truly the music of the
            Celestial Demons!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The dying Guqin Demon looked at Chu Kuangren, but there was no hint
            of resentment in his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, there was a sense of yearning and a kind of...
            satisfaction!
          </p>
          <p>
            “You truly are a wonder for being able to play such music. Do tell
            me your name.” Guqin Demon looked at Chu Kuangren with a curious
            gaze.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s Chu Kuangren!”</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

          </div>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, Chu Kuangren... Haha. Dying from guqin music like
            this may not be a bad thing after all...”
          </p>
          <p>“Are you very impressed?”</p>
          <p>“Having heard something so wonderful, I can die content!”</p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon uttered as the hostility on his face faded away. In the
            end, he died with a smile.
          </p>
          <p>However, the same could not be said for Art Ghoul beside him.</p>
          <p>
            He was a painter, after all, so he was not that content with dying
            like Guqin Demon.
          </p>
          <p>
            He struggled to take out a Great Shift Talisman from his Yin and
            Yang ring, seeking to use it to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was at that moment when a foot stepped onto his arm, kicking that
            Great Shift Talisman away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren looked at him and said nothing. Instead, he unleashed a
            streak of sword qi from his finger towards his opponent and ended
            Art Ghoul’s life once and for all.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, he kept both of their Yin and Yang rings as well.</p>
          <p>He had gained quite a lot of rewards this time.</p>
          <p>
            The greatest reward being the Springtime Lightning recognizing him
            as its master.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pairing of Emperor Weapon and his Eight Celestial Demonic Chords
            was now one of Chu Kuangren’s most powerful techniques!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Congratulations for gaining the Emperor Weapon’s acknowledgment,
            Brother Chu.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Melodious Void Sect Master walked to Chu Kuangren with a passion
            burning in her eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The look she had on her was worlds apart from her previously
            unfriendliness.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Huh, Brother Chu? Melodious Void Sect Master, are you acquainted
            with this person as well?”
          </p>
          <p>The Phantasmic Melody Sect Master asked curiously.</p>
          <p>
            “Of course, Brother Chu is an esteemed guest of my Melodious Void
            Sect.” The Melodious Void Sect Master chuckled.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren was very amused to hear that.</p>
          <p>
            He had lived in the Melodious Void Sect for several days, yet no one
            cared about him at all besides meeting Melodious Void Sect Master on
            the first day.
          </p>
          <p>He was still an esteemed guest despite all that??</p>
          <p>However, he did not comment much on that matter.</p>
          <p>
            After all, Murong Xuan and Yang Xiyun were a couple, and it was very
            likely that their sects would become in-laws in the future as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Young man, as the master of the Springtime Lightning, you shall be
            my Phantasmic Melody Sect’s distinguished guest from now on.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Brother Chu, you’re always welcome to visit my Ji clan whenever you
            wish as well.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The few Boundary Emperors were trying to get on good terms with Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from his profound mastery in guqin cultivation, Chu Kuangren’s
            combat strength alone was enough for them to have him as their ally.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Haha. I’ve known since seeing him at Cloudveil Pavilion that
            Brother Chu is remarkable. He’s truly extraordinary.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s right, that’s right.”</p>
          <p>
            “Brother Chu, you have gotten rid of a great harm for us guqin
            cultivators today by killing Guqin Demon.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The other guqin cultivators all went up to compliment and
            congratulate him.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there was one person who was staring at Chu Kuangren with a
            chilling gaze.
          </p>
          <p>That person was the Sword Tribe’s Jian Changfeng.</p>
          <p>
            He looked at Chu Kuangren and sneered. “Everyone, do remember to
            think twice before you build relations with someone new. Precious
            lives might be lost if one happens to be on the wrong side.”
          </p>

          <h4>
            Chapter 524: The Eight Celestial Demonic Chords Reappears, Killing
            Guqin Demon And Art Ghoul
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>“Guqin, come to me!!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren shouted, and coupled with the guqin music Daoist Rhyme
            that was surging on his body, the Emperor Weapon Springtime
            Lightning suddenly began to react.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Springtime Lightning, which none of the guqin cultivators could
            resonate with no matter how hard they tried, trembled violently.
          </p>
          <p>
            An overpowering surge of guqin music Daoist Rhyme and Emperor’s Aura
            erupted before it resonated with Chu Kuangren’s guqin music Daoist
            Rhyme. Everyone was stunned.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning then turned into a blue bolt
            of lightning and disappeared on the spot, heading towards Chu
            Kuangren at breakneck speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a blink of an eye, the Emperor Weapon Springtime Lightning broke
            through Art Ghoul’s painting world as it flew towards Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>Thousands of ghouls were wiped out wherever it went!</p>
          <p>
            The bolt of lightning stopped in front of Chu Kuangren, where it
            reverted to the Springtime Lightning’s form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its crystal blue body was carved with gorgeous patterns, and it had
            an extraordinary Daoist Rhyme...
          </p>
          <p>
            Every aspect demonstrated that this Emperor Weapon was no ordinary
            item.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite its pride and arrogance as an Emperor Weapon, it levitated
            calmly before Chu Kuangren as if waiting for him to play it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren gently brushed his fingers across the Springtime
            Lightning’s body and murmured, “If you deem me as your master, I
            shall use you to play the most beautiful and grand music the world
            has ever heard!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Springtime Lightning trembled lightly as if it was responding to
            Chu Kuangren’s voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every guqin cultivator outside the world within the painting was
            stupefied.
          </p>
          <p>
            They could not even make the Springtime Lightning move despite
            giving their best effort. Yet, it straight up deemed Chu Kuangren as
            its master just because he commanded it to do so?!
          </p>
          <p>That power gap between them was just too big!!</p>
          <p>“How can such a skilled guqin master exist in this world!!”</p>
          <p>“Unbelievable. This is simply unbelievable!”</p>
          <p>
            This scene was just too shocking even for cultivators like the Ji
            Clan Leader and others who were at the peak of guqin Dao.
          </p>
          <p>
            They would not be so surprised if the Springtime Lightning had
            simply deemed someone as its master.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the way the Springtime Lightning acknowledged Chu Kuangren
            as its master was just too much for them to handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So what if you have the help of the Emperor Weapon? With Art Ghoul
            and my combined power, we’re undefeatable in this world!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon yelled. His behavior was starting to get a little crazed
            at that time, and his guqin music had become increasingly chaotic.
          </p>
          <p>It was the same with Art Ghoul as well.</p>
          <p>
            Using his spiritual power as ink, he kept on drawing out countless
            ferocious ghouls to attack Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren simply pressed his fingers on the Springtime
            Lightning’s string and said, “Have a taste of the Celestial Demonic
            Chords!”
          </p>
          <p>With a clang, guqin music echoed in the realm.</p>
          <p>
            First Movement of the Eight Celestial Demonic Chords, Boundless
            Overworld!
          </p>
          <p>
            Boundless and overbearing qi that contained the energy of the world
            began to attack everything in the world within the painting!

          <p>Second Movement, Endless Torrential Gale!</p>
          <p>
            Guqin music turned into countless wind scythes, which built up into
            a terrifying hurricane that swept out in all directions and killed
            thousands of ghouls at once!
          </p>
          <p>Third Movement, Profound Carillon Resonance!</p>
          <p>
            A piece of simple guqin music emerged, blasting Guqin Demon backward
            once again!
          </p>
          <p>Fourth Movement, Assaulting Convergence!</p>
          <p>
            Guqin music surged in from all directions, attacking the painting
            world!
          </p>
          <p>
            Five Movement, Unending Voracious Vigor; Sixth Movement, Devastating
            Cyclone Barrage; Seventh Movement, Synchronous Overworld Anarchy...
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Seventh Movement played, the painting world started to give
            way under the multiple waves of guqin music Daoist Rhyme.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the heavens and earth within it trembled, the painting world
            immediately crumbled!
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the might of that terrifying power, Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul
            suffered a heavy blow.
          </p>
          <p>Even so, Chu Kuangren’s guqin music did not stop there.</p>
          <p>Sounds of guqin music continued to echo in the realm.</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, all eyes were on the figure who was playing the
            guqin. Nothing else was worth their attention more than this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was as if he and that guqin were the only things that remained in
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            As waves of guqin music Daoist Rhyme reverberated through the void,
            everyone could feel as if they had turned deaf as they could not
            hear anything.
          </p>
          <p>However, their souls were still trembling uncontrollably.</p>
          <p>
            The impact of Chu Kuangren’s guqin music had far exceeded the limits
            of their senses, and it was reaching into their souls instead!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Final Movement of the Eight Celestial Demonic Chords, Grand Melodic
            Void!” n0𝐕𝑒𝒍𝗎𝐒𝓫.𝒸0𝓶
          </p>
          <p>
            The final movement of the eight rang out and unleashed an
            indescribable surge of guqin music Daoist Rhyme, which poured out
            like an endless torrential wave!
          </p>
          <p>It was silent, but it shook the very heavens and earth!</p>
          <p>
            “Grand Melodic Void. It’s the Grand Melodic Void!! This is the real
            Grand Melodic Void!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Melodious Void Sect Master looked at Chu Kuangren with
            amazement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their sect was named the Melodious Void Sect because they adhered to
            the concept of the void and simplicity that formed the core of their
            melody.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no one in the Melodious Void Sect has ever achieved that
            level even until now. To her surprise, she was witnessing it from an
            outsider instead!
          </p>
          <p>
            With the Grand Melodic Void playing, overbearing and endless surges
            of guqin music Daoist Rhyme instantly erupted onto both Guqin Demon
            and Art Ghoul.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two top-notched Boundary Emperors could no longer resist the
            might of that attack and were injured to the brink of death.
          </p>
          <p>
            By then, their Boundary Emperor physique had already been damaged to
            the point of no return.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of them were lying on the ground, their brush and guqin strings
            broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The music of the Celestial Demons. This is truly the music of the
            Celestial Demons!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The dying Guqin Demon looked at Chu Kuangren, but there was no hint
            of resentment in his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, there was a sense of yearning and a kind of...
            satisfaction!
          </p>
          <p>
            “You truly are a wonder for being able to play such music. Do tell
            me your name.” Guqin Demon looked at Chu Kuangren with a curious
            gaze.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s Chu Kuangren!”</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">

          </div>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, Chu Kuangren... Haha. Dying from guqin music like
            this may not be a bad thing after all...”
          </p>
          <p>“Are you very impressed?”</p>
          <p>“Having heard something so wonderful, I can die content!”</p>
          <p>
            Guqin Demon uttered as the hostility on his face faded away. In the
            end, he died with a smile.
          </p>
          <p>However, the same could not be said for Art Ghoul beside him.</p>
          <p>
            He was a painter, after all, so he was not that content with dying
            like Guqin Demon.
          </p>
          <p>
            He struggled to take out a Great Shift Talisman from his Yin and
            Yang ring, seeking to use it to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was at that moment when a foot stepped onto his arm, kicking that
            Great Shift Talisman away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren looked at him and said nothing. Instead, he unleashed a
            streak of sword qi from his finger towards his opponent and ended
            Art Ghoul’s life once and for all.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, he kept both of their Yin and Yang rings as well.</p>
          <p>He had gained quite a lot of rewards this time.</p>
          <p>
            The greatest reward being the Springtime Lightning recognizing him
            as its master.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pairing of Emperor Weapon and his Eight Celestial Demonic Chords
            was now one of Chu Kuangren’s most powerful techniques!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Congratulations for gaining the Emperor Weapon’s acknowledgment,
            Brother Chu.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Melodious Void Sect Master walked to Chu Kuangren with a passion
            burning in her eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The look she had on her was worlds apart from her previously
            unfriendliness.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Huh, Brother Chu? Melodious Void Sect Master, are you acquainted
            with this person as well?”
          </p>
          <p>The Phantasmic Melody Sect Master asked curiously.</p>
          <p>
            “Of course, Brother Chu is an esteemed guest of my Melodious Void
            Sect.” The Melodious Void Sect Master chuckled.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren was very amused to hear that.</p>
          <p>
            He had lived in the Melodious Void Sect for several days, yet no one
            cared about him at all besides meeting Melodious Void Sect Master on
            the first day.
          </p>
          <p>He was still an esteemed guest despite all that??</p>
          <p>However, he did not comment much on that matter.</p>
          <p>
            After all, Murong Xuan and Yang Xiyun were a couple, and it was very
            likely that their sects would become in-laws in the future as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Young man, as the master of the Springtime Lightning, you shall be
            my Phantasmic Melody Sect’s distinguished guest from now on.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Brother Chu, you’re always welcome to visit my Ji clan whenever you
            wish as well.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The few Boundary Emperors were trying to get on good terms with Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from his profound mastery in guqin cultivation, Chu Kuangren’s
            combat strength alone was enough for them to have him as their ally.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Haha. I’ve known since seeing him at Cloudveil Pavilion that
            Brother Chu is remarkable. He’s truly extraordinary.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s right, that’s right.”</p>
          <p>
            “Brother Chu, you have gotten rid of a great harm for us guqin
            cultivators today by killing Guqin Demon.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The other guqin cultivators all went up to compliment and
            congratulate him.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there was one person who was staring at Chu Kuangren with a
            chilling gaze.
          </p>
          <p>That person was the Sword Tribe’s Jian Changfeng.</p>
          <p>
            He looked at Chu Kuangren and sneered. “Everyone, do remember to
            think twice before you build relations with someone new. Precious
            lives might be lost if one happens to be on the wrong side.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>
            Chapter 526: Jian Changfeng’s Challenge, The Mega Formation That
            Engulfed A City
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, I want to become an Emperor!”</p>
          <p>Murong Xuan said determinedly.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren initially reacted with a strange look in his eyes, but
            he soon nodded with a smile. “Alright. I’m happy that you have some
            ambitions in you.”
          </p>
          <p>There was nothing better than seeing Murong Xuan persevering.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan possessed an unyielding Daoist core, hence such an
            incident would not hamper his motivation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m definitely going to become an Emperor! It’s only through
            becoming an Emperor that all can be overcome. By then, the Sword
            Tribe and Melodious Void Sect can all go to hell!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan glanced toward the end of the Emperor Road and was
            overpowered by a boost of morale.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The power of love is indeed magnificent.” Shang Qingxue observed
            aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the trio left the Melodious Void Sect, they went to stay at
            one of the guesthouses of Seven Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Springtime Lightning, the Emperor Weapon, had acknowledged
            Chu Kuangren as its owner, he still needed to refine the weapon
            further to maximize its potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, due to the Springtime Lightning’s acknowledgment, Chu
            Kuangren did not take long to refine it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of Chu Kuangren’s cultivation level, he had managed to fully
            refine the Springtime Lightning within two days.
          </p>
          <p>
            During that period, Chu Kuangren had also received a piece of sudden
            news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng of the Sword Tribe had wished to challenge Chu
            Kuangren to a duel at Blaze City, a location not far away from Seven
            Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>The people of Seven Chord City were shocked, to say the least.</p>
          <p>
            Although Jian Changfeng was an excellent sky-pride of the Emperor
            Road who possessed remarkable abilities, Chu Kuangren’s display of
            power during his battle against Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul had far
            surpassed that of Jian Changfeng. Just how did he muster such
            courage to challenge Chu Kuangren?
          </p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan were puzzled too.</p>
          <p>“Has he lost his mind?”</p>
          <p>
            “Things aren’t as simple as they look. There must be something that
            we’re unaware of.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue were discussing in the guesthouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Chu Kuangren had already exited his closed-door
            meditation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan told Chu Kuangren everything he knew about Jian
            Changfeng’s challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            After listening, Chu Kuangren looked rather mischievous.
            “Challenging me? Since when did he get so brave?”
          </p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, there must be foul play involved.”</p>
          <p>
            “Heh, that’s for sure. However, I have nothing better to do anyway.
            I’ll just drop by quickly and see what games they have for me.”
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said keenly.</p>
          <p>
            He then instructed Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue to remain in the
            guesthouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren left a strain of sword qi each for Murong Xuan and
            Shang Qingxue for their safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi could be used to defend against enemies and allowed Chu
            Kuangren to track their whereabouts. That way, they could keep in
            contact, unlike before.
          </p>
          <p>
            After making the necessary preparations, Chu Kuangren ventured into
            the Blaze City to check out the situation.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Blaze City was a smaller city than Seven Chord City.</p>
          <p>
            However, Blaze City had cut off all connections to the outer world a
            few days ago, as if the entire city was engulfed by an invisible
            form of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peering into the Blaze City from the outside, one could only see an
            abandoned city that was void of all human presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren arrived above the Blaze City and could sense that
            something was off.
          </p>
          <p>“Are these... traces of a formation?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had acquired a decent amount of knowledge about
            formations from having previously set up the Astonishing Cloud of
            Seas Formation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although his expertise was still below mastery, Chu Kuangren could
            observe clear traces of formation around the Blaze City.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Someone has surrounded Blaze City with a mega formation. Could it
            be Jian Changfeng?”
          </p>

            “That’s not right. The Eye of Revelation did not reveal any
            information about the person’s ability to set up formations. This
            must be the doing of another person.”
          </p>
          <p>Something was clearly not right in the Blaze City.</p>
          <p>
            With that, Chu Kuangren vanished in a flash and stepped into Blaze
            City.
          </p>
          <p>He seemed to have arrived in a completely different world.</p>
          <p>This was... a living hell!</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren glanced at his surroundings. The citizens of Blaze City
            were all lying on the ground, devoid of any vitality as the foul
            stench of blood permeated in the air.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren frowned and mobilized his spiritual thought.</p>
          <p>The elderly, the children, the women, the cultivators...</p>
          <p>
            Not even the dogs, the birds, nor any animals had managed to
            survive!
          </p>
          <p>There were still people in Blaze City!</p>
          <p>However, they were all dead!</p>
          <p>It was such an unbelievable scene.</p>
          <p>
            Blaze City may not be huge, but it was still home to more than ten
            million people. Yet, all of them are dead now!
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, there was no news about it.</p>

          <p>“Who did this? Did they do all this just to spike me?”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren’s eyes were burning with brutal murderous intent.</p>
          <p>In a flash, he arrived at the central part of Blaze City.</p>
          <p>
            A youngster in white clothes stood above a tower. The handsome man
            had a long sword strapped to his waist and a guqin on his back.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was none other than the person who challenged Chu Kuangren to a
            duel, Jian Changfeng.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Since I’m here, why don’t you ask your partners to show themselves
            too and make this quick?” Chu Kuangren said nonchalantly.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, aren’t you curious why this entire city’s dead?”</p>
          <p>
            “They’re already dead anyway. What can I do if I know about it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Pfft, you truly are a heartless b*stard. I’ll have you know that
            all of these people died for you!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng laughed maniacally with his eyes fixed on Chu
            Kuangren. He was keen to observe Chu Kuangren’s reaction.
          </p>
          <p>To his disappointment, Chu Kuangren was utterly unfazed.</p>
          <p>
            “You’re very wrong if you think this might shake my Daoist core.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said calmly. His Daoist core was as solid as rock, and
            no one had been able to affect it ever since he began his
            cultivation journey.
          </p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng’s taunts were useless.</p>
          <p>
            “Even cultivators who are trained in the Merciless Dao aren’t as
            heartless as you. Aren’t you afraid the ghosts of these victims will
            come back to haunt you?”
          </p>
          <p>“You speak too much nonsense.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren stared coldly at Jian Changfeng. Without drawing his
            Self Descendant Sword, a surge of devastating sword qi unleashed
            from his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Caught off guard, Jian Changfeng retaliated with a similar surge of
            sword qi by sheathing his long sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, his sword qi was much feeble and weak compared to Chu
            Kuangren’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng’s sword ray instantly reduced into dust as Chu
            Kuangren’s remaining attack fell onto Jian Changfeng’s Sage
            Physique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without much resistance, Jian Changfen’s body was sliced into
            halves!
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet strangely enough, there was no blood spurting from Jian
            Changfen’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            As smoke curled up, Jian Changfeng’s body turned into a wooden dummy
            and fell onto the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wooden dummy was inscribed with a mysterious rune. After it was
            severed by Chu Kuangren’s sword qi, the strange runic energy on it
            soon disappeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, a wooden dummy that’s inscribed with a rune. I’ve never seen
            such a form of runic energy before. How interesting.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren smirked and looked into the distance.</p>
          <p>
            The real Jian Changfeng was standing dozens of kilometers away,
            staring at Chu Kuangren in fear as cold sweat drenched his forehead.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is so scary. If I didn’t switch my body with the wooden dummy
            in time, the sword qi might’ve sliced me in half.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even without drawing his sword, Chu Kuangren’s single ray of sword
            qi is capable of such destruction. He’s also renowned for his
            abilities in guqin Dao, but his expertise in sword Dao is much more
            impressive than mine, or perhaps even sitting at the same level as
            the Daoist. He’s such a terrifying figure.”
          </p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng said with unease.</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, I want to become an Emperor!”</p>
          <p>Murong Xuan said determinedly.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren initially reacted with a strange look in his eyes, but
            he soon nodded with a smile. “Alright. I’m happy that you have some
            ambitions in you.”
          </p>
          <p>There was nothing better than seeing Murong Xuan persevering.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan possessed an unyielding Daoist core, hence such an
            incident would not hamper his motivation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m definitely going to become an Emperor! It’s only through
            becoming an Emperor that all can be overcome. By then, the Sword
            Tribe and Melodious Void Sect can all go to hell!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan glanced toward the end of the Emperor Road and was
            overpowered by a boost of morale.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The power of love is indeed magnificent.” Shang Qingxue observed
            aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the trio left the Melodious Void Sect, they went to stay at
            one of the guesthouses of Seven Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Springtime Lightning, the Emperor Weapon, had acknowledged
            Chu Kuangren as its owner, he still needed to refine the weapon
            further to maximize its potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, due to the Springtime Lightning’s acknowledgment, Chu
            Kuangren did not take long to refine it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of Chu Kuangren’s cultivation level, he had managed to fully
            refine the Springtime Lightning within two days.
          </p>
          <p>
            During that period, Chu Kuangren had also received a piece of sudden
            news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng of the Sword Tribe had wished to challenge Chu
            Kuangren to a duel at Blaze City, a location not far away from Seven
            Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>The people of Seven Chord City were shocked, to say the least.</p>
          <p>
            Although Jian Changfeng was an excellent sky-pride of the Emperor
            Road who possessed remarkable abilities, Chu Kuangren’s display of
            power during his battle against Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul had far
            surpassed that of Jian Changfeng. Just how did he muster such
            courage to challenge Chu Kuangren?
          </p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan were puzzled too.</p>
          <p>“Has he lost his mind?”</p>
          <p>
            “Things aren’t as simple as they look. There must be something that
            we’re unaware of.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue were discussing in the guesthouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Chu Kuangren had already exited his closed-door
            meditation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan told Chu Kuangren everything he knew about Jian
            Changfeng’s challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            After listening, Chu Kuangren looked rather mischievous.
            “Challenging me? Since when did he get so brave?”
          </p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, there must be foul play involved.”</p>
          <p>
            “Heh, that’s for sure. However, I have nothing better to do anyway.
            I’ll just drop by quickly and see what games they have for me.”
          </p>

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said keenly.</p>
          <p>
            He then instructed Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue to remain in the
            guesthouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren left a strain of sword qi each for Murong Xuan and
            Shang Qingxue for their safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi could be used to defend against enemies and allowed Chu
            Kuangren to track their whereabouts. That way, they could keep in
            contact, unlike before.
          </p>
          <p>
            After making the necessary preparations, Chu Kuangren ventured into
            the Blaze City to check out the situation.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Blaze City was a smaller city than Seven Chord City.</p>
          <p>
            However, Blaze City had cut off all connections to the outer world a
            few days ago, as if the entire city was engulfed by an invisible
            form of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peering into the Blaze City from the outside, one could only see an
            abandoned city that was void of all human presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren arrived above the Blaze City and could sense that
            something was off.
          </p>
          <p>“Are these... traces of a formation?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had acquired a decent amount of knowledge about
            formations from having previously set up the Astonishing Cloud of
            Seas Formation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although his expertise was still below mastery, Chu Kuangren could
            observe clear traces of formation around the Blaze City.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Someone has surrounded Blaze City with a mega formation. Could it
            be Jian Changfeng?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s not right. The Eye of Revelation did not reveal any
            information about the person’s ability to set up formations. This
            must be the doing of another person.”
          </p>
          <p>Something was clearly not right in the Blaze City.</p>
          <p>
            With that, Chu Kuangren vanished in a flash and stepped into Blaze
            City.

            As smoke curled up, Jian Changfeng’s body turned into a wooden dummy
            and fell onto the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wooden dummy was inscribed with a mysterious rune. After it was
            severed by Chu Kuangren’s sword qi, the strange runic energy on it
            soon disappeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, a wooden dummy that’s inscribed with a rune. I’ve never seen
            such a form of runic energy before. How interesting.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren smirked and looked into the distance.</p>
          <p>
            The real Jian Changfeng was standing dozens of kilometers away,
            staring at Chu Kuangren in fear as cold sweat drenched his forehead.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is so scary. If I didn’t switch my body with the wooden dummy
            in time, the sword qi might’ve sliced me in half.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even without drawing his sword, Chu Kuangren’s single ray of sword
            qi is capable of such destruction. He’s also renowned for his
            abilities in guqin Dao, but his expertise in sword Dao is much more
            impressive than mine, or perhaps even sitting at the same level as
            the Daoist. He’s such a terrifying figure.”
          </p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng said with unease.</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, I want to become an Emperor!”</p>
          <p>Murong Xuan said determinedly.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren initially reacted with a strange look in his eyes, but
            he soon nodded with a smile. “Alright. I’m happy that you have some
            ambitions in you.”
          </p>
          <p>There was nothing better than seeing Murong Xuan persevering.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan possessed an unyielding Daoist core, hence such an
            incident would not hamper his motivation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m definitely going to become an Emperor! It’s only through
            becoming an Emperor that all can be overcome. By then, the Sword
            Tribe and Melodious Void Sect can all go to hell!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan glanced toward the end of the Emperor Road and was
            overpowered by a boost of morale.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The power of love is indeed magnificent.” Shang Qingxue observed
            aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the trio left the Melodious Void Sect, they went to stay at
            one of the guesthouses of Seven Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Springtime Lightning, the Emperor Weapon, had acknowledged
            Chu Kuangren as its owner, he still needed to refine the weapon
            further to maximize its potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, due to the Springtime Lightning’s acknowledgment, Chu
            Kuangren did not take long to refine it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of Chu Kuangren’s cultivation level, he had managed to fully
            refine the Springtime Lightning within two days.
          </p>
          <p>
            During that period, Chu Kuangren had also received a piece of sudden
            news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng of the Sword Tribe had wished to challenge Chu
            Kuangren to a duel at Blaze City, a location not far away from Seven
            Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>The people of Seven Chord City were shocked, to say the least.</p>
          <p>
            Although Jian Changfeng was an excellent sky-pride of the Emperor
            Road who possessed remarkable abilities, Chu Kuangren’s display of
            power during his battle against Guqin Demon and Art Ghoul had far
            surpassed that of Jian Changfeng. Just how did he muster such
            courage to challenge Chu Kuangren?
          </p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan were puzzled too.</p>
          <p>“Has he lost his mind?”</p>
          <p>
            “Things aren’t as simple as they look. There must be something that
            we’re unaware of.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue were discussing in the guesthouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Chu Kuangren had already exited his closed-door
            meditation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan told Chu Kuangren everything he knew about Jian
            Changfeng’s challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            After listening, Chu Kuangren looked rather mischievous.
            “Challenging me? Since when did he get so brave?”
          </p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, there must be foul play involved.”</p>
          <p>
            “Heh, that’s for sure. However, I have nothing better to do anyway.
            I’ll just drop by quickly and see what games they have for me.”
          </p>

                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said keenly.</p>
          <p>
            He then instructed Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue to remain in the
            guesthouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren left a strain of sword qi each for Murong Xuan and
            Shang Qingxue for their safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi could be used to defend against enemies and allowed Chu
            Kuangren to track their whereabouts. That way, they could keep in
            contact, unlike before.
          </p>
          <p>
            After making the necessary preparations, Chu Kuangren ventured into
            the Blaze City to check out the situation.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Blaze City was a smaller city than Seven Chord City.</p>
          <p>
            However, Blaze City had cut off all connections to the outer world a
            few days ago, as if the entire city was engulfed by an invisible
            form of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peering into the Blaze City from the outside, one could only see an
            abandoned city that was void of all human presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren arrived above the Blaze City and could sense that
            something was off.
          </p>
          <p>“Are these... traces of a formation?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had acquired a decent amount of knowledge about
            formations from having previously set up the Astonishing Cloud of
            Seas Formation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although his expertise was still below mastery, Chu Kuangren could
            observe clear traces of formation around the Blaze City.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Someone has surrounded Blaze City with a mega formation. Could it
            be Jian Changfeng?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s not right. The Eye of Revelation did not reveal any
            information about the person’s ability to set up formations. This
            must be the doing of another person.”
          </p>
          <p>Something was clearly not right in the Blaze City.</p>
          <p>
            With that, Chu Kuangren vanished in a flash and stepped into Blaze
            City.
          </p>
          <p>He seemed to have arrived in a completely different world.</p>
          <p>This was... a living hell!</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren glanced at his surroundings. The citizens of Blaze City
            were all lying on the ground, devoid of any vitality as the foul
            stench of blood permeated in the air.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren frowned and mobilized his spiritual thought.</p>
          <p>The elderly, the children, the women, the cultivators...</p>
          <p>
            Not even the dogs, the birds, nor any animals had managed to
            survive!
          </p>
          <p>There were still people in Blaze City!</p>
          <p>However, they were all dead!</p>
          <p>It was such an unbelievable scene.</p>
          <p>
            Blaze City may not be huge, but it was still home to more than ten
            million people. Yet, all of them are dead now!
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, there was no news about it.</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>“Who did this? Did they do all this just to spike me?”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren’s eyes were burning with brutal murderous intent.</p>
          <p>In a flash, he arrived at the central part of Blaze City.</p>
          <p>
            A youngster in white clothes stood above a tower. The handsome man
            had a long sword strapped to his waist and a guqin on his back.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was none other than the person who challenged Chu Kuangren to a
            duel, Jian Changfeng.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Since I’m here, why don’t you ask your partners to show themselves
            too and make this quick?” Chu Kuangren said nonchalantly.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, aren’t you curious why this entire city’s dead?”</p>
          <p>
            “They’re already dead anyway. What can I do if I know about it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Pfft, you truly are a heartless b*stard. I’ll have you know that
            all of these people died for you!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng laughed maniacally with his eyes fixed on Chu
            Kuangren. He was keen to observe Chu Kuangren’s reaction.
          </p>
          <p>To his disappointment, Chu Kuangren was utterly unfazed.</p>
          <p>
            “You’re very wrong if you think this might shake my Daoist core.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said calmly. His Daoist core was as solid as rock, and
            no one had been able to affect it ever since he began his
            cultivation journey.
          </p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng’s taunts were useless.</p>
          <p>
            “Even cultivators who are trained in the Merciless Dao aren’t as
            heartless as you. Aren’t you afraid the ghosts of these victims will
            come back to haunt you?”
          </p>
          <p>“You speak too much nonsense.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren stared coldly at Jian Changfeng. Without drawing his
            Self Descendant Sword, a surge of devastating sword qi unleashed
            from his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Caught off guard, Jian Changfeng retaliated with a similar surge of
            sword qi by sheathing his long sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, his sword qi was much feeble and weak compared to Chu
            Kuangren’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng’s sword ray instantly reduced into dust as Chu
            Kuangren’s remaining attack fell onto Jian Changfeng’s Sage
            Physique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without much resistance, Jian Changfen’s body was sliced into
            halves!
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet strangely enough, there was no blood spurting from Jian
            Changfen’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            As smoke curled up, Jian Changfeng’s body turned into a wooden dummy
            and fell onto the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wooden dummy was inscribed with a mysterious rune. After it was
            severed by Chu Kuangren’s sword qi, the strange runic energy on it
            soon disappeared.

          <p></p>
          <p>While Chu Kuangren was battling Swordsman Yan in Blaze City.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue were facing their own problems back at
            Seven Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>The guesthouse was almost vacated now.</p>
          <p>
            A lady in a black robe stood before Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lady’s features were impeccable, and her eyes exuded a soft and
            charming presence. She was probably capable of seducing ninety-nine
            percent of men in this world.
          </p>
          <p>Unfortunately for her, Murong Xuan was not one of them.</p>
          <p>
            His heart belonged to someone else. Besides, Murong Xuan could sense
            a tinge of threat coming from this lady.
          </p>
          <p>“Who are you?” Murong Xuan frowned and asked.</p>
          <p>
            “I’m Swordsman Mei, one of the members of the Shadow Swordsmen.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsmen Mei chuckled coquettishly and looked at the duo. “All
            thanks to Swordsman Yan for dealing with Chu Kuangren, I now have
            the perfect opportunity to deal with you two.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Deal with us? Are you thinking of using us to threaten our Sect
            Leader?”
          </p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue said.</p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue knew that Murong Xuan and herself were not worth the
            trouble for the Sword Tribe. Their ultimate goal must be Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, well, we sure have a smart little icy lady in the house. It’s
            such a shame that you just don’t have the power to change the
            outcome.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei vanished into the shadows and dashed for Shang
            Qingxue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue simply lifted her hand and summoned a surge of
            unbearable freezing qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The freezing qi froze the space before her, and Swordsman Mei was
            forced to take several steps back. She looked at Shang Qingxue
            gravely and said, “I didn’t expect you to be capable of such a feat.
            I recognize this freezing qi. Are you the host of the Deep Freeze
            Physique?”
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, Swordsman Yan was unsure of her assessment. Not
            even the Deep Freeze Physique would be capable of such a display of
            freezing qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even Murong Xuan was shocked. “Qingxue, it looks like you’ve been
            blessed with an unordinary opportunity too.”
          </p>
          <p>“Too?”</p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue smiled mischievously.</p>
          <p>
            “Let’s talk about it later. We have Swordsman Mei to deal with.
            She’s not an easy one.”
          </p>
          <p>Murong Xuan chuckled and stared at Swordsman Mei.</p>
          <p>
            Despite the duo’s tremendous progress in their abilities and having
            encountered various opportunities in Emperor Road, they could not
            tread lightly in the face of Swordsman Mei, one of the most
            excellent fighters in Sword Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, two outside world sky-prides... Let’s see just what you’re
            made of.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei sneered. As one of the few stellar sky-prides of the
            Sword Tribe, she carried her pride around with her. She feared no
            one else apart from the Sword Daoists and some of the outlawed
            sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Attack!” Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue attacked Swordsman Mei from
            different sides.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since Swordsman Mei had wanted to use them to threaten Chu Kuangren,
            they no longer cared about honor codes on the battlefield. If they
            had to outnumber her, so be it.
          </p>
          <p>The trio’s swords clanked with each other in the center.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan’s imposing dominance, Shang Qingxue’s freezing blizzard,
            and Swordsman Mei’s dark maliciousness...
          </p>
          <p>
            As their sword Dao made contact, the guesthouse ruptured from
            within.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Yan may be strong, but she could not overpower Murong Xuan
            and Shang Qingxue once they worked together.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it. I’ve underestimated them.”</p>
          <p>
            ‘I didn’t think Chu Kuangren’s disciples would also be so
            remarkable. Just what kind of sect is the Black Heaven Sect?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei thought to herself and mustered all her strengths to
            defeat the duo.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no matter how hard she tried, she could not gain a
            significant edge over her opponents.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it. It looks like I need to use that thing.”</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei gritted her teeth. Now that Chu Kuangren had left, she
            only had one chance to accomplish her mission. Once Chu Kuangren
            came back, her chance would be gone.
          </p>
          <p>She retrieved a medicinal pill and swallowed it.</p>
          <p>
            Soon, an eerie, dark sword qi erupted from her body. “Lightless
            Sword Domain!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Countless dark sword qi intertwined in the void. It was as if a
            shade of night had engulfed everything within a ten-kilometer
            radius, forming a dark domain!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Be careful, Qingxue. Her abilities have drastically increased.”
          </p>
          <p>“Such power is on the level of a Boundary Emperor.”</p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan’s faces turned grim.</p>
          <p>“Fall!”</p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei lifted her sword and unleashed a black sword qi.</p>
          <p>
            With the dark Daoist Rhyme contained in the sword qi, it was as if
            the entire night sky was crashing toward them.
          </p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan’s faces turned grim.</p>
          <p>
            Just then, a surge of purple sword qi suddenly erupted from Murong
            Xuan’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi poured like a torrent and disintegrated Swordsman Mei’s
            sword qi before it crashed into the nightshade. As a result, a large
            hole was ripped in the nightshade, and the gap became wider with
            each passing second.
          </p>
          <p>
            As sunlight pierced through the shade, the Lightless Sword Domain
            was destroyed!
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei began to panic upon seeing this scene. “What sword qi
            is that?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            A single sword technique had ruptured both her sword qi and her
            domain!
          </p>
          <p>
            Such a display of power was indicative of a person far more powerful
            than any ordinary Boundary Emperor!
          </p>
          <p>“It’s Sect Leader’s sword qi!”</p>
          <p>Shang Qingxue said joyfully.</p>
          <p>Then, her body released another similar surge of sword qi.</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            This time, the sword qi transformed into a white-robed figure in the
            air.
          </p>
          <p>It was Chu Kuangren! n0𝔳𝔢𝓛𝑈𝑠𝐛.𝑐0𝔪</p>
          <p>
            With Chu Kuangren as the center point, sword qi released and spread
            across the area, locking Swordsman Mei as its target.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was Swordsman Mei’s first time witnessing Chu Kuangen’s sword
            Dao, and she felt a numbing sensation over her scalp as fear
            overwhelmed her.
          </p>
          <p>“How is this level of power possible?”</p>
          <p>
            “Isn’t Chu Kuangren busy dealing with Swordsman Yan? It can’t be.
            This must only be his spiritual thought clone!”
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Swordsman Mei did not rejoice at her observation. Instead,
            her panic worsened.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a spiritual thought clone could possess such an amount of power,
            just how strong was Chu Kuangren?!
          </p>
          <p>
            Would such an entity be capable of defeating the Master Sword
            Daoist?!
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first time in her life, Swordsman Mei was questioning the
            Sword Daoist’s abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was all because Chu Kuangren’s display of power was far too
            mind-numbing. It had exceeded her understanding of what a sky-pride
            was.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, so this is your plan? To keep me busy so that you can kidnap
            them and threaten me?”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren snapped coldly.</p>
          <p>
            Although he was just a spiritual thought clone, Swordsman Mei felt
            that she was facing an otherworldly God of War.
          </p>
          <p>“Run!”</p>
          <p>
            No longer able to contain her fear, Swordsman Mei turned and tried
            to escape.
          </p>
          <p>“Run? But can you?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren transformed into a sword ray and teleported in front of
            Swordsman Mei in the blink of an eye.
          </p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei screamed and instinctively swung her sword.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren merely responded by hurling a dagger towards Swordsman
            Mei.
          </p>
          <p>
            The speed of the dagger was not fast. It gradually glided across the
            battlefield, but it ferried a boundless amount of Heavenly Might.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Swordsman Mei could reach Chu Kuangren, her entire body was
            already stifled by the crushing aura, and her sword qi
            disintegrated.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren’s dagger struck directly into her chest.</p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            As the sword qi pierced through her body, a cloud of blood mist
            erupted from her back.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Chu Kuangren needed was a single dagger to strip her off any
            ability to resist.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Qingxue, Murong Xuan, watch over her and don’t let her die. Wait
            for my return.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said faintly. He seemed to have some arrangements in
            mind for Swordsman Mei.
          </p>
          <p>Then, his figure vanished in the air.</p>
          <p>
            Ten million kilometers away, Chu Kuangren was staring at Swordsman
            Yan with brutal murderous intent.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright. Playtime’s over.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren positioned all his fingers on the guqin, infusing a
            magnificent Heavenly Might into his guqin Daoist Rhymes!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>
            Chapter 530: Killing Swordsman Yan, Implanting A Slave Seal,
            Purifying Blaze City
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren began plucking at his guqin with all of his fingers,
            infusing a boundless surge of Heavenly Might into his guqin music.
          </p>
          <p>It was the Heavenly Punishment Daoist Rhymes!</p>
          <p>
            As the guqin music spread, one wave after another, its magnificent
            might shook everything within a thousand kilometers radius.
          </p>
          <p>
            Countless living beings knelt on the ground when they heard the
            music. It was the instinctive response of life itself towards the
            Heavenly Might!
          </p>
          <p>
            Needless to say, Swordsman Yan, who was standing near the guqin
            music, could not resist. Despite his Rage Qi Absorption granting him
            an increase in his combat strength, his strong body began to crack,
            and crevices began to form all over his body.
          </p>
          <p>“How? How’s that possible?!”</p>
          <p>“No, no!”</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Yan screamed in terror as the vengeful souls began to slip
            out of the crevices.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it, d*mn it. Go back inside!”</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Yan swung his sword as if he was forcing the wandering
            vengeful souls back into his body.
          </p>
          <p>However, his efforts were futile.</p>
          <p>
            Having already spent too long in the state of Rage Qi Absorption,
            the Eight Celestial Demonic Chord had exhausted his body of all
            energies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Countless vengeful souls pried out of his body, yet they did not
            flee. Instead, they stared ferociously at Swordsman Yan, their eyes
            seething with a deep sense of hatred.
          </p>
          <p>“Give me back my life!”</p>
          <p>“I’ll kill you. I’ll kill you...”</p>
          <p>
            The vengeful souls swarmed towards Swordsman Yan and began devouring
            his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            By now, Swordsman Yan had lost all control over the vengeful souls
            that were retaliating against their former master.
          </p>
          <p>“No, no...”</p>
          <p>
            Following the loss of his rage qi, Swordsman Yan’s body began to
            return to its frail state and regained his former senses.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he witnessed the horde of vengeful souls staring into him,
            Swordsman Yan was overwhelmed with a sense of horror that he had
            never felt before.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pain inflicted by the jaws of millions of vengeful souls was
            unbearable, to say the least.
          </p>
          <p>
            Followed by a long wail, Swordsman Yan perished within the horde of
            vengeful souls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Yan, who once ruled the battlefield using his mastery of
            rage qi, had unfortunately perished in his own elements.
          </p>
          <p>How ironic.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was unfazed as he watched the gruesome scene unfold and
            kept the Springtime Lightning away into his inventory. “You reap
            what you sow.”
          </p>
          <p>Then, Chu Kuangren glanced toward the distance not far away.</p>
          <p>
            He noticed a figure frantically escaping into the distance. It was
            none other than Jian Changfeng.
          </p>
          <p>“Where can you go?”</p>

            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s gaze was cold as he unleashed a formless mind power
            with his hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng felt his entire body grasped by an invisible hand. As
            such, he froze in the air in spite of himself.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on?!”</p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng was horrified.</p>
          <p>
            He did not pick up on any hint of spiritual powers and was clueless
            as to how he was captured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, Jian Changfeng could do nothing but watch as Chu Kuangren came
            closer to him.
          </p>
          <p>“What do you want?!”</p>
          <p>
            “I’m a sky-pride of the Sword Tribe. Killing me will only escalate
            the feud you have with them. Please let go of me. I’ll beg for your
            mercy when I return...”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng pleaded as he tried to find a way to get out of the
            situation alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren merely looked at him indifferently and said, “Do you
            think I need your help to beg for my mercy?”
          </p>
          <p>He pointed his finger and aimed at Jian Changfeng’s forehead.</p>
          <p>“Please don’t!”</p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng was mortified.</p>
          <p>
            When Chu Kuangren tapped on his forehead, Jian Changfeng did not
            feel the pain he expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, there was a chilling sensation that gradually made its way
            into his mind.
          </p>
          <p>What was going on?</p>
          <p>
            Just as Jian Changfeng was confused, he felt the chilling sensation
            penetrating deeper into his mind.
          </p>
          <p>It was as if it was about to reach the depth of his soul!</p>
          <p>This was bad!</p>
          <p>
            Although Jian Changfeng did not know what plans Chu Kuangren had, he
            resisted instinctively.
          </p>
          <p>
            He channeled his spiritual power and spiritual thought to resist the
            chilling sensation.
          </p>
          <p>It seemed to work.</p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng felt the chilling sensation finally stopped.</p>
          <p>“Oh, I don’t think you have what it takes to resist!”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren lightly grunted and mobilized his mind power.</p>
          <p>
            All Jian Changfeng felt was a surge of oppressive energy crushing
            violently on his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intense pain hit all of his nerves, which made Jian Changfeng
            feel as though his body was about to be ground into a paste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under such a situation, Jian Changfeng no longer had control over
            his spiritual power and spiritual thought as he became distracted.
          </p>
          <p>“Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal!”</p>
          <p>
            As soon as Chu Kuangren grunted, the chilling sensation went
            straight into Jian Changfeng’s soul and branded it with a golden
            “slave” seal.
          </p>
          <p>Only then did Chu Kuangren finally retract his hands.</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            On the other hand, Jian Changfeng seemed to understand the situation
            now. He cowered in the middle of the air as he stared at Chu
            Kuangren in horror.
          </p>
          <p>A slave seal!</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren had implanted a slave seal in his soul!</p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng could not believe that Chu Kuangren could use a
            technique like the Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, his entire life and death would be dictated by a single strain
            of Chu Kuangren’s thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Head back to the Sword Tribe and report any uncommon events to me,”
            Chu Kuangren said calmly.
          </p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng attempted to resist.</p>
          <p>
            However, a stinging pain radiated from his soul. The more he
            resisted, the more intense the pain became.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng eventually felt as if his soul would be ripped apart
            at any moment.
          </p>
          <p>Cold sweat drenched his forehead, and his face was white.</p>
          <p>
            At last, Jian Changfeng was forced to concede to the source of his
            pain and nodded. “Alright!”
          </p>
          <p>As such, he returned to the ground and left the city.</p>
          <p>
            Looking at his departing figure, Chu Kuangren murmured, “The
            Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal isn’t something you can resist.”
          </p>
          <p>Soon.</p>
          <p>
            The slave seal would gradually alter Jian Changfeng’s thoughts and
            turn him into Chu Kuangren’s most loyal servant!
          </p>
          <p>
            He would provide Chu Kuangren with every information about the Sword
            Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Sword Tribe? Ha. I don’t mind taking my time in this game.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A cold grin appeared on Chu Kuangren’s face before he turned his
            eyes onto the mounting corpses and the horde of vengeful souls in
            Blaze City.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Chu Kuangren ignored them, the vengeful souls might spread and
            cause terrifying havoc in other cities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps, the vengeful souls may corrode the corpses and turn them
            into zombies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Chu Kuangren did not kill these people, they did die
            because of him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren did not feel remorse. After all, this world was based
            on survival for the fittest.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, he felt he could at least do something to make this
            situation better.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that, Chu Kuangren lifted his hands and mobilized his formless
            mind power above, forming lines of runes over the city that
            transformed into blazing fires!

          <h4>
            Chapter 531: I Don’t Lack Soul Emblems, Swordsman Mei Who Would
            Rather Die Than Surrender
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>Inside Seven Chord City.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had just returned from Blaze City. He went back to the
            inn, only to be welcomed by wreckage.
          </p>
          <p>Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue were nowhere to be found.</p>
          <p>
            “I don’t care what happened. This inn of mine has operated for
            several hundred years and garnered high praises from everyone in
            Seven Chord City. But now, you’ve demolished the whole
            establishment. Don’t even think of running away before you
            compensate me with several dozen grams of soul emblems.”
          </p>
          <p>The inn owner caught Chu Kuangren and refused to let him leave.</p>
          <p>
            Not far away, Yang Xiyun walked up to them. She was here because she
            was worried about Murong Xuan’s safety. “We’ll pay for whatever
            they’ve damaged,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Xiyun, don’t take on more than you can chew. This has got nothing
            to do with us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside her, Melodious Void Sect Master suggested. She stared at Chu
            Kuangren with a sense of satisfaction at his misfortunes in her
            eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Since you guys were acting arrogant earlier, let’s see how you can
            deal with this now’
          </p>
          <p>“Honorable Teacher, I owe it to Brother Murong.”</p>
          <p>
            Yang Xiyun frowned. Deep down, she felt a little disappointed at
            Melodious Void Sect Master.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It doesn’t matter how he helped you. We, the Melodious Void Sect,
            had already taken care of him here for quite a significant amount of
            time. We even offered him soul emblems, but he chose to reject them.
            Of course, if Brother Chu wants to claim those soul emblems back for
            his use now, I won’t necessarily say no...” Melodious Void Sect
            Master said as she looked at Chu Kuangren mockingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s no need for that. I can still afford this little bit of
            soul emblems.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren casually tossed out a Yin and Yang Ring, which had a
            hundred over grams of soul emblems inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was merely a drop in the bucket for someone as wealthy as Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            That inn owner took the Yin and Yang Ring and took a glance at it.
            Almost immediately, his face turned to joy. “Consider everything
            that happened today settled then. See you around, Sect Leader Chu.”
          </p>
          <p>The inn owner grabbed the soul emblems and left in a hurry.</p>
          <p>
            With this amount of soul emblems, he could totally build a few more
            inns like this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the side, Melodious Void Sect Master looked annoyed when she saw
            how easily Chu Kuangren could come up with several dozen grams of
            soul emblems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren did not pay heed to her at all as he proceeded to
            contact Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue. He found out that the two of
            them were currently inside a jungle in Seven Chord City.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, he left the scene and came to the place where Murong Xuan
            and Shang Qingxue were at.
          </p>
          <p>Besides the two of them, Swordsman Mei was also there</p>
          <p>
            At this point in time, Swordsman Mei was lying on the ground. Her
            chest had been punctured by sword qi. Ubiquitous sword qi swirled
            around her wound, locking her spiritual power.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a hint of paleness on her pretty face, and she looked
            incredibly helpless. It was very hard for anyone not to have any
            sympathy for her. n0𝗏𝓔𝑳𝓊𝐬𝚋.𝔠0𝕞

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, Chu Kuangren stared at her calmly while activating his
            Eye of Revelation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Swordsman Mei, one of the Shadow Swordsmen of Sword Tribe. Owns the
            Dark Descent Physique, skilled in Dark Dao...”
          </p>
          <p>
            Dark Descent Physique was one of the Three-Thousand Physiques. It
            was also a Supreme Daoist Physique, one that was almost equal level
            with Lan Yu’s Holy Radiant Physique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such a Daoist Physique would make her one of the most top-notch
            sky-prides even in a place like the Sword Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s surprising that a sky-pride of your standard would become one
            of the Shadow Swordsmen,” Chu Kuangren said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, for Master Daoist, it doesn’t matter if I’ll be bound to
            endless darkness for my entire life.”
          </p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei scoffed back at him.</p>
          <p>
            “Oh, Master Daoist? You’re talking about the Sword Tribe’s Daoist,
            am I right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Since you’ve already beaten me, why don’t you just end me already?
            You can give up your hopes of obtaining any info regarding the Sword
            Tribe or Master Daoist from me.”
          </p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei looked like she would rather die than surrender.</p>
          <p>
            “It would be a waste to kill you just like that. I’m still thinking
            of that Supreme Daoist Physique of yours, the Dark Descent
            Physique.”
          </p>
          <p>“What do you want then?”</p>
          <p>“You’ll soon find out.”</p>
          <p>The edge of Chu Kuangren’s lips curled into a cold grin.</p>
          <p>
            He thrust a sword finger sign, with which a ray of light shot out
            from his fingertip, piercing into the defenseless Swordsman Mei’s
            mind.
          </p>
          <p>As suspected, it was the Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal!</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei noticed that something was amiss. In a frenzied
            effort, she tried everything to fight off the slave seal’s
            incursion.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, her power was no match to Chu Kuangren. Adding to the fact
            that her body was heavily wounded, all forms of resistance would
            only prove to be futile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before long, the Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal was marked on the
            deepest etches of her soul.
          </p>
          <p>“B*stard!! You’d be crazy to think that you can enslave me!!”</p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei’s delicate face glared at Chu Kuangren fiercely.</p>
          <p>“Whether I’m crazy or not, we’ll soon find out.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren replied indifferently. With a flicker of his mind, the
            sword qi on Swordsman Mei’s body dissipated, and her spiritual power
            recovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Swordsman Mei saw that, she tried to utilize her spiritual
            power and dragged her heavily injured body toward Chu Kuangren for
            retaliation.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan chuckled when they saw that.
          </p>
          <p>
            She could not even beat Chu Kuangren’s spiritual thought clone in
            her prime, let alone wanting to fight his actual form in her
            mortally wounded body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren, on the other hand, had no intention of using any force
            on her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right when Swordsman Mei was getting closer and closer to Chu
            Kuangren, an agonizing pain suddenly came from the depths of her
            mind.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>It was an intense pain that originated from the soul itself!</p>
          <p>
            That was the punishment that the slave seal brought upon her for
            disobeying her master!
          </p>
          <p>
            The excruciating astral pain made Swordsman Mei’s petite body
            tremble incessantly. She could not withstand it any longer and
            collapsed onto the floor on her knees. The sword that she was
            holding also loosened from her grasp and dropped onto the floor.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I might not have the strength to kill you, but I’ll never allow you
            to use me against Master Daoist!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            From the outside, Swordsman Mei may look soft and gentle, but deep
            inside, she was a very resilient character.
          </p>
          <p>
            She conceded that she would not be able to kill Chu Kuangren. Hence,
            in order to prevent herself from causing any harm to Master Daoist,
            she endured the harrowing pain and picked up the longsword that she
            dropped once more, slashing it at her throat. The sharp sword blade
            ripped open the smooth skin on her neck, and huge amounts of fresh
            blood spurted out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was shocked to see Swordsman Mei killing herself in
            front of him. “Hey, I must admit. Your loyalty for the Sword Tribe
            and Sword Daoist is truly remarkable.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With that, he stretched out his arm and cast the Spring Breeze
            Healing Technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            The life force from the surroundings amassed before it surged into
            Swordsman Mei’s body continuously.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the help of such a powerful healing-type Emperor Technique, the
            gash on Swordsman Mei’s neck healed rapidly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shortly after, Swordsman Mei had recovered back to her usual self.
          </p>
          <p>
            She touched her neck and found that there was no scar at all. If not
            for the blood traces that spurted all around her, she would have
            thought that the sequence earlier was just a dream.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren, of all people, had rescued her.</p>
          <p>
            Still, she was not gullible enough to believe that he did that to
            help her.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, a sense of despair welled up in her.</p>
          <p>
            She had never imagined that in front of Chu Kuangren, she would have
            no control of even her own death.
          </p>
          <p>
            “How the hell are you planning to use me to get back on the Sword
            Tribe?” Swordsman Mei questioned him coldly.
          </p>
          <p>“Relax.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren mobilized his spiritual thoughts. The next moment, a
            rune was formed and transformed into a collar that wrapped around
            Swordsman Mei’s neck.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that instant, Swordsman Mei could feel the spiritual power in her
            getting locked inside her own spiritual mound!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Qingxue, I’ll leave her to you. Keep her close to your side for
            now, and don’t let her escape,” Chu Kuangren ordered.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes.” Shang Qingxue nodded.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan, who was beside her, appeared quite puzzled. “Sect
            Leader, this woman is so resilient and unrequited. I’m worried that
            we’ll have a tough time handling her.”
          </p>
          <p>“Heh, you’ll figure it out soon enough.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren let out a slight chuckle. The true power of the
            Soul-Vanquishing Slave Seal had not been fully expressed yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having gotten the hint, Murong Xuan stopped asking further
            questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that, the three of them continued their journey to the end of
            Emperor Road with Swordsman Mei by their side.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, they did not encounter any major opportunity of fortune
            along their way this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, the Emperor Road was a huge place. Although quite a
            number of Opportunities of Fortune had already emerged, they would
            still need that tad bit of luck to encounter one themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, many opportunities of fortune had already been snatched by
            the various major forces here. It was almost impossible for a normal
            cultivator to get any share of that.

            Chapter 532: The Domineering Slave Seal, Swordsman Mei Submits
            Herself To Rule
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            “Swordsman Mei, do you by any chance know any newly-surfaced
            Opportunity of Fortune?”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren asked Swordsman Mei.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue were stunned when they heard the
            question. They looked at Chu Kuangren with a weird look in their
            eyes.
          </p>
          <p>Why did he ask that?</p>
          <p>Would Swordsman Mei even bother answering?</p>
          <p>
            She would most probably prefer to chop him into pieces. There was no
            way she was going to tell him such important intel.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they had suspected, Swordsman Mei merely sneered at him. “You
            really think I will tell you about the Enchanted Forest Realm?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue stared at each other, wide-eyed in
            surprise.
          </p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei, especially, was utterly shocked.</p>
          <p>What did she just say??</p>
          <p>
            Why did she tell Chu Kuangren about the Enchanted Forest Realm? What
            was going on?!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, Enchanted Forest Realm, huh? What Opportunity of Fortune is
            this?” Chu Kuangren added to his inquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Impossible. I’ll never tell you anything about the Enchanted Forest
            Realm. If you want to know more, you’d have to go to the Dark Aether
            Prefecture to find out.”
          </p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei said aloud.</p>
          <p>
            “Oh, it means that the Enchanted Forest Realm is in Dark Aether
            Prefecture?” Chu Kuangren smiled.
          </p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei’s expression turned increasingly terrified.</p>
          <p>What was this?</p>
          <p>
            Why was she spilling more info to Chu Kuangren against her will?!
          </p>
          <p>“What the hell have you done to me?”</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei questioned him in rage, “What other effects does that
            slave seal have?!”
          </p>
          <p>“Come on. Let’s go to Dark Aether Prefecture.”</p>
          <p>
            No explanation whatsoever was given to her as Chu Kuangren got up
            and led Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue to the direction of Dark
            Aether Prefecture.
          </p>
          <p>On their way there, the group passed by a large river.</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei gazed at that river, then back at her outfit which was
            stained dirty with blood. Suddenly, she could feel the uncomfortable
            itch all over her body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren glanced at her and said, “Qingxue, help her wash up a
            little and change into some new clothes.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsmen Mei, who was standing at the side, felt a little
            suspicious at his intentions.
          </p>
          <p>Was he really this kind?</p>
          <p>
            “You’re so awfully unkempt that people might think we’re bringing
            along a beggar. How embarrassing.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren’s words fuelled the rage inside Swordsman Mei.</p>

          <p>This d*mn b*stard...</p>
          <p>
            However, just as she had that thought, her soul started to hurt
            again.
          </p>
          <p>D*mn you, d*mn you!</p>
          <p>
            She was not allowed to have any ill-mannered thoughts about Chu
            Kuangren at all?!
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the threat of the slave seal, Swordsman Mei immediately
            suppressed any disrespectful thoughts that she had against Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>Shortly after.</p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue was done with helping Swordsman Mei wash up and
            brought her back to the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            The swordsman had already changed to a new black dress. Her
            shoulder-length black hair, fair as snow skin, and pair of bright
            eyes gave her a somewhat attractive charm.
          </p>
          <p>It was hard to deny that Swordsman Mei was actually a stunner.</p>
          <p>A stunner that would prove especially deadly amongst men.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren took a glance at her and commented, “Now, you look more
            bearable. I won’t feel too ashamed now to bring you along.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordman Mei’s lips twitched as she forced herself to abandon the
            thoughts of wanting to murder Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>The group continued their journey to Dark Aether Prefecture.</p>
          <p>
            During their few days on the road, Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan
            found that Swordsman Mei’s attitude toward Chu Kuangren was slowly
            changing, much to their surprise.
          </p>
          <p>
            From her extreme hatred at the very beginning to a gradual terror,
            then to reverence that she now showed toward Chu Kuangren in every
            action that she took.
          </p>
          <p>
            In just a few days, her attitude toward Chu Kuangren had a complete
            turn-around. It was as if she had become a whole different person.
          </p>
          <p>This astonished Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue.</p>
          <p>
            “How amazing is our Sect Leader? He has managed to subdue Swordsman
            Mei in just a short few days’ time. He didn’t even do much in this
            period.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah. Besides, Sect Leader has been taunting her all this while. Is
            this kind of cold treatment Swordsman Mei’s thing?”
          </p>
          <p>“No way, right...?”</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue were both scratching their heads at
            that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, they went to ask Chu Kuangren about it, but he merely
            shrugged it off with a smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the night before they would arrive at Dark Aether Prefecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei went to meet Chu Kuangren, her emotions visibly
            perturbed.
          </p>
          <p>
            These past few days, she was aware of the changes that she had been
            experiencing. Still, she had absolutely no control over everything
            that had been happening to her.
          </p>
          <p>At first, she was terrified of this feeling.</p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, she slowly grew numb to it. Right now, she had already
            conceded to these changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “When are you going to set me free?” Swordsmen Mai asked Chu
            Kuangren face to face.
          </p>
          <p>“About time now.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren looked up into the sky and stared at the moon as he
            said, “Tonight, you’ll be allowed to leave.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei was momentarily stunned. She did not think it would be
            so easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment Swordsman Mei heard that she would be free, she felt an
            emotion brewing deep inside her heart. She seemed... reluctant?!
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>“Are you not afraid that I’ll tell the Sword Tribe everything?”</p>
          <p>“Will you?” Chu Kuangren deflected the question back to her.</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei fell silent when she heard that. She then shook her
            head and replied, “I won’t.”
          </p>
          <p>“We’re settled, then.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren took out an almost transparent, colored glaze lamp that
            looked pristine inside and out. That was the Divine Emerald Lamp he
            had obtained from the Wu clan a while back.
          </p>
          <p>“Take this lamp back and save yourself.”</p>
          <p>“This is... the Divine Emerald Lamp?!” n0𝐯𝓮𝓁𝔲𝔰𝔟.𝐂0𝐦</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei was sent here to assassinate Chu Kuangren, so she
            clearly knew a thing or two about the Divine Emerald Lamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, she knew how important this lamp was to the Sword
            Daoist. It was as vital as an Opportunity of Fortune to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If this lamp falls into Sword Daoist’s hands, I fear his strength
            will improve to an unimaginable height. Why are you even doing this,
            Master?”
          </p>
          <p>Swordsmen Mei felt a little perplexed.</p>
          <p>
            Just when the words exited her mouth, she abruptly came back to her
            senses and realized, did she just refer to Chu Kuangren as Master?!
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only that, but she was even concerned about Chu Kuangren’s
            safety, so much that she had placed it above Sword Daoist, who had
            been her priority all this while!
          </p>
          <p>
            This was not something that she would have ever done in the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old her would rule anything about Sword Daoist more important
            than everything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Chu Kuangren’s place in her heart had now overtaken the Sword
            Daoist’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren glanced back at her. Deep down, he could not help but
            admit the marvels of this slave seal. It was truly domineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s just a lamp. It doesn’t really matter if I hand it over to
            him. Besides, this lamp is connected to an Opportunity of Fortune,
            so I don’t mind Sword Daoist taking over my job of looking for it.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren explained.</p>
          <p>
            The Divine Emerald Lamp was still incomplete, so it did not really
            have much use for him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist, on the other hand, had been sending people here to
            snatch the divine lamp, so Chu Kuangren suspected that this divine
            lamp’s missing piece must be in his possession.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, the divine lamp, in a complete state, would lead
            them to a Sword Emperor. Such an Opportunity of Fortune was
            definitely not what Chu Kuangren would like to miss out on so
            easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since Sword Daoist had not come to him yet, he would send the lamp
            over to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sword Daoist, I hope you won’t let me down. Uncover that
            opportunity of fortune soon.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren muttered.</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei accepted the Divine Emerald Lamp and simultaneously
            handed him a jade scroll. She said, “I’ve written down all the
            information I know about the Sword Tribe here. Apart from that, I’ve
            also included some intel about the Enchanted Forest Realm. I hope
            it’ll be of some help to you, Master.”
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, understood.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren kept the jade scroll.</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei took a final glance at Chu Kuangren before her figure
            flashed, turning into a black shadow that instantly blended into the
            darkness. With that, she disappeared from sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once Swordsman Mei had left, Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue both
            walked out.
          </p>
          <p>They stared at Chu Kuangren with a face full of admiration.</p>
          <p>
            “Wow, Sect Leader, that was way too impressive. I can’t believe
            Swordsman Mei is calling you Master now. What a huge change!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You really think that your Sect Leader’s tricks are all just for
            show?”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren laughed it off.</p>
          <p>
            The next day, the three of them reached Dark Aether Prefecture. They
            did some research on Enchanted Forest Realm to verify the intel that
            Swordsman Mei provided to them.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Chapter 533: Swordsman Mei Returns To The Sword Tribe, Sword
            Daoist’s Means
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The Enchanted Forest Realm was not at all a super mythical place. It
            was merely a secret realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, the Opportunity of Fortune in this secret realm was way
            too huge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Enchanted Forest Realm only appears in Emperor Road once every
            thirty thousand years. Every time it shows up, it would present
            numerous Opportunities of Fortune.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there were a ranking for Opportunities of Fortune in Emperor
            Road, the Enchanted Forest Realm would surely rank amongst the top
            ten!
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, it had only been twenty thousand years since the Enchanted
            Forest Realm’s last appearance in the realm. Logically speaking, now
            was not the time for the Enchanted Forest Realm to open up yet.
            However, due to the odd changes on Emperor Mountain, which
            culminated in the Emperor’s Throne emergence, the Enchanted Forest
            Realm’s opening time had been brought forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only a few of the most elite forces knew about this, and their
            sky-prides were already making the necessary preparations for their
            respective explorations in the Enchanted Forest Realm.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Back at the Sword Tribe.</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei had returned. She was currently having an audience
            with the Sword Tribe Leader in one of the palaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Tribe Leader, I have failed to assassinate Chu Kuangren. I beg your
            forgiveness.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei knelt down in front of Sword Tribe Leader, pleading
            with a face full of guilt.
          </p>

            Although Sword Tribe Leader was disappointed over her failure in
            killing Chu Kuangren, he never harbored any real intention of
            punishing Swordsman Mei. After all, she was a top-notch sky-pride in
            Sword Tribe, second only to Sword Daoist. With her Supreme Daoist
            Physique, she could prove to be an imperative cornerstone of the
            Sword Tribe’s future.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s alright, Swordsman Mei. Get on your feet. Even Swordsman Yan
            couldn’t succeed. It is impressive enough that you’re able to return
            alive. It’s my fault to have underestimated Chu Kuangren.”
            n0𝐯𝐞𝓵𝐮𝐬𝓫.𝑐0𝓶
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you, Tribe Leader.”</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei stood up and took out the Divine Emerald Lamp. “Tribe
            Leader, I may have failed to assassinate Chu Kuangren, but I did
            bring back the Divine Emerald Lamp.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When Sword Tribe Leader heard that, a strange look was expressed in
            his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>His first reaction was not joy, but rather, confusion.</p>
          <p>
            “Not even Swordsman San and Swordsman Yan were able to do this. How
            did you manage to pull this off?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sword Tribe Leader’s gaze glistened as he stared straight at
            Swordsman Mei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Swordsman Mei had already prepared the perfect excuse
            long ago. “Honestly, all credits are owed to Swordsman Yan. It was
            him who distracted Chu Kuangren and created the chance for me to
            strike at Chu Kuangren’s two disciples. I blackmailed him for this
            Divine Emerald Lamp in exchange for their lives.”

          <p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
          <p>
            Sword Tribe Leader continued staring at Swordsman Mei, but she did
            not even flinch.
          </p>
          <p>Following that, he asked her some more questions.</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei still managed to answer them eloquently, dispelling
            any suspicion left in Sword Tribe Leader.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Bringing back the Divine Emerald Lamp is already an amazing feat.
            Swordsman Mei, how would you like to be rewarded? Feel free to make
            a request.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m a swordsman, and my duty is to serve the Sword Tribe. Helping
            the tribe accomplish these is merely my responsibility. I don’t dare
            to ask for any reward.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hah, you’re too humble. Just say whatever you would like. As long
            as it’s achievable in the Sword Tribe, I’ll grant your wish.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Truth be told, I’ve admired Sword Daoist for a long time now. I
            wish I could serve alongside him and help him out.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After a moment’s hesitation, Swordsman Mei finally revealed her
            wish. When she mentioned Sword Daoist’s name, there was a sense of
            longing in her eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing that, Sword Tribe Leader burst out into laughter.
            “Actually, I’ve known since long ago that you joined the Shadow
            Swordsmen for Sword Daoist. Since you’re so sincere about it, I
            shall grant you your wish. The Sword Daoist is still lacking one
            person to form his three-man Secret Guard squad. I’ll let you fill
            that spot.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Additionally, I’ll reward you with the bestial soul of a Black
            Cloud Iron Beast. This item is compatible with your Dark Descent
            Physique. I’m sure it’ll benefit you greatly.”
          </p>
          <p>“Many thanks, Tribe Leader!”</p>
          <p>Just then, a figure walked into the great hall.</p>
          <p>
            This person wore a gorgeous golden robe. He had delicate eyebrows
            and dazzling eyes, and a ruthless aura circulating on his body.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, we were just talking about the Daoist, and here he is.”</p>
          <p>
            Sword Tribe Leader said as he looked toward that young man. This man
            was indeed the Sword Tribe’s Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Swordsman Mei next to him noticed something amiss. “No,
            this energy is somewhat different from the usual Master Daoist.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Good one, Mei’er. Your intuition is correct. This figure that
            you’re seeing right now is indeed not my true body but my clone.
            I’ve obtained this clone through an Opportunity of Fortune. It has
            eighty percent of my strength.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist smiled at Swordsman Mei. It seemed like both of them
            have known each other for quite a long time.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s remarkable, Master Daoist. I admire that.”</p>
          <p>There was a look of admiration on Swordsman Mei’s face.</p>
          <p>
            “Heh, since my true body will still be in closed-door meditation
            when the Enchanted Forest Realm opens, I plan to send this clone
            over. Although it has only eighty percent of my strength, I believe
            it’ll be enough to wreck the young guns of Emperor Road!” Sword
            Daoist was proud of himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s the Sword Daoist that we know. With this energy and
            confidence, I’m sure you’ll ascend to the Emperor’s Throne and rule
            over the people of this firmament!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist smiled gently in response. Then, he saw the Divine
            Emerald Lamp in Sword Tribe Leader’s hands, and his eyes lit up as
            he exclaimed, “This is the Divine Emerald Lamp!!”
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">

            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            “That’s right. This is the Divine Emerald Lamp that Swordsman Mei
            has brought back.”
          </p>
          <p>“Mei’er, you’ve managed to kill Chu Kuangren?”</p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist asked as he glanced at Swordsman Mei with amazement.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he had stared at her like that in the past, she would have been
            on cloud nine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet now, Swordsman Mei only responded with a grim look on her face.
            “I’m too incompetent. I couldn’t kill that d*mned Chu Kuangren...”
          </p>
          <p>She repeated what she had said to Sword Tribe Leader.</p>
          <p>
            “It seems that this Chu Kuangren is truly fascinating. Heh. If I
            could meet this guy in the Enchanted Forest Realm, I’d be sure to
            have a go at him.”
          </p>
          <p>Swordsman Mei could not help but secretly rolled her eyes.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Come on. Even if it is your real body, you would still not survive
            more than three sword strikes from her Master.’
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Currently, this clone of yours possesses eighty percent of your
            full strength. You can consider yourself lucky if Master didn’t kill
            you with one slap. From where did you get such confidence?’
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mei’er must’ve been through hell to take back this Divine Emerald
            Lamp for me, but fret not. If I happen to encounter that Chu
            Kuangren, I would surely make him pay for what he did to you.”
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you, Master Daoist.”</p>
          <p>“There’s no need for such humility between the two of us.”</p>
          <p>Sword Daoist smiled at her.</p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist had known Swordsman Mei for quite some time now, and he
            also knew that she had a deep affection for him, that she even
            joined the Shadow Swordsmen just for him.
          </p>
          <p>As such, he took pride in this regard.</p>
          <p>
            After all, how many people in this world could get a stunner like
            Swordsman Mei as devoted as he had?
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, despite Swordsman Mei’s care towards him all this
            while, he merely viewed her as a tool for him to manage the Sword
            Tribe’s affairs.
          </p>
          <p>Sword Daoist’s heart had already belonged to someone else.</p>
          <p>
            “With the Enchanted Forest Realm opening this time, Ning Yu would be
            there too, I think. I haven’t seen her for a long time now...”
          </p>
          <p>A reminiscent look washed over Sword Daoist’s face.</p>
          <p>
            Swordsman Mei’s expression changed slightly when she heard the name
            ‘Ning Yu’, and she immediately excused herself. “Tribe Leader,
            Master Daoist, if there are no other matters, I shall get going
            then.”
          </p>
          <p>“Sure, you may leave now.”</p>
          <p>Sword Tribe Leader nodded gently.</p>
          <p>
            Once Swordsman Mei was a distance away, Sword Tribe Leader said,
            “Sword Daoist, you know that Swordsman Mei likes you, yet you still
            mention another woman’s name right in front of her. Aren’t you just
            making her unhappy? Are you afraid that she’ll resent you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m only doing this to remind her that I already have someone in my
            heart. Don’t you think, Tribe Leader, that the more you can’t get
            something, the more attractive they are? Unfortunately, for Mei’er,
            the harder I make it for her, the more she would want to try to win
            me over, and she’ll never be freed from my grasp.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Realization dawned on Sword Tribe Leader when he heard that. “Hah,
            Sword Daoist, your means have really opened up a whole new
            perspective for me,” he said and chuckled.

          <p>
            Dark Aether Prefecture, the place where the Enchanted Forest Realm
            was situated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the intel provided by Swordsman Mei, Chu Kuangren, Shang
            Qingxue, and Murong Xuan came to the mountain range where the
            Enchanted Forest Realm was located.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the Enchanted Forest Realm had not appeared yet, there were
            already a lot of people here waiting. The whole mountain range had
            numerous sky-prides parading it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among these sky-prides, the weaker ones were at least a Supreme
            Honorable or even Sage. Some of these top-notch sky-prides were so
            strong that they could give the older generation elites a run for
            their money.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for those outlawed sky-prides who were the pinnacle class of
            sky-prides, Chu Kuangren had yet to see any of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, there are so many people here. I don’t think any one of their
            strengths should be underestimated.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan said solemnly while looking at the sky-prides around
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the outside world, Murong Xuan was considered one of the most
            top-notch sky-prides. Even those empyrean walkers in the past were
            not his match at all. However, in Emperor Road, where there were
            endless sky-prides, he might still be categorized as outstanding,
            but he was definitely not within the top-notch category.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Only by cultivating the Sky Blazing Divine Seal to the highest
            level can I compete with those most top-notch outlawed sky-prides!”
          </p>
          <p>Murong Xuan muttered under his breath.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren, who was beside him, seemed to have overheard his words
            as he let out a slight smile but opted not to ask him more about it.
          </p>
          <p>He knew that Murong Xuan had his own Opportunity of Fortune.</p>
          <p>
            “Sect Leader, when is this Enchanted Forest Realm going to open?”
            Shang Qingxue asked curiously.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In two more days, I think. When the Enchanted Forest Realm opens,
            the concordant transformations will appear.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren explained. He was, in fact, not in a rush after all.
          </p>
          <p>After that, he initiated his Treasure Locating Skill.</p>
          <p>
            Images of all sorts of treasures within several kilometers radius
            instantly projected into his mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There really are quite a lot of decent treasures on this mountain
            range that’ll be helpful for the two of you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren took out a jade scroll and jotted down the info about
            the treasures on it. He then handed it over to his two disciples.
            “Here. You can try looking for these treasures.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, Sect Leader.”</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue had known since long ago that Chu
            Kuangren possessed some sort of treasure-detecting method. Hence,
            they were not too surprised by his action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the Enchanted Forest Realm was opened, the two were already
            one step ahead of everyone else as they began collecting treasures.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Chu Kuangren’s Treasure Locating Skill, they managed to loot
            quite a number of good stuff in just two days.

          <p>On this day, Murong Xuan found a Supreme Elixir.</p>
          <p>
            That Supreme Elixir grew in a volcanic crater and emanated with
            incredibly strong Fire-based Daoist Rhyme energy waves. This Supreme
            Elixir was at least an Emperor-grade.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With this Supreme Elixir, my Sky Blazing Divine Seal should be able
            to advance to the fifth stage. I’m one step closer to the seventh
            stage now.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan’s eyes lit up, and he quickly made his way to the
            volcanic crater.
          </p>
          <p>
            The voracious volcanic energy, to him, was only like warm air. It
            did not have any effect on him.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, just when he was about to harvest that Supreme Elixir, a
            pike strength that was infused with ruthless energy surged toward
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that, Murong Xuan immediately activated his Crimson Sun Daoist
            Physique and drew a crimson longsword in his hand!
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a weapon that he had obtained after entering Emperor Road,
            named the Blazing Sun!
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as Blazing Sun clashed violently with that pike strength,
            terrifying power promptly exploded. To Murong Xuan’s surprise, he
            was blasted back several dozen meters.
          </p>
          <p>
            He looked into the distance to see a young man in a golden robe
            standing in the air. He was holding a pike on one hand, with
            formidable energy flowing through his body.
          </p>
          <p>“That Supreme Elixir belongs to me. You, scramble!”</p>
          <p>The young man jeered at Murong Xuan.</p>
          <p>
            “Ah, and I was thinking who it was. Turns out it’s you, Xiao
            Jingchen,” Murong Xuan responded, a defiant look on his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Xiao Jingchen was a third-ranked Soaring Dragon Leaderboard
            sky-pride.
          </p>
          <p>He was also the host of the Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique.</p>
          <p>
            This physique was extremely powerful. Of the Three-Thousand Daoist
            Physiques, it even ranked above the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword
            Heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, Murong Xuan did not seem to show any signs of fear
            before Xiao Jingchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, you know about the Soaring Dragon Leaderboard. You must be from
            the Firmament Star, then. With such strength, I wonder which
            sky-pride you are on the Soaring Dragon Leaderboard?”
          </p>
          <p>Xiao Jingchen looked at Murong Xuan in astonishment.</p>
          <p>“Murong Xuan, from the Black Heaven Sect!”</p>
          <p>
            When the three words Black Heaven Sect were said, a fear seeped
            through Xiao Jingchen’s eyes. It was as if he recalled something
            bad, and he hurriedly glanced at his surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>“Black Heaven Sect... Is Chu Kuangren here too?”</p>
          <p>
            “It doesn’t matter whether or not Sect Leader is here. If you want
            this Supreme Elixir, you must first get through me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A battle intent flashed in Murong Xuan’s eyes as he tightened his
            grip on the Blazing Sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            He wanted to find out how big of a gap there was between himself and
            a top-notch sky-pride like Xiao Jingchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            He wondered if there was a chance that he might emerge victoriously!
          </p>
          <p>“Hmph, so it’s just you?”</p>
          <p>
            After scanning his surroundings and not seeing Chu Kuangren
            anywhere, Xiao Jingchen relaxed.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Of the entire Firmament Star, aside from Chu Kuangren, he did not
            fear anyone else!
          </p>
          <p>“It’s just me!!”</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan stepped forward. An incredibly searing heat wave erupted
            from his body, almost as if he was about to incinerate this whole
            place into ashes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. I guess I’ll let you have a taste of the Heavenly Golden
            Imperial Physique’s power!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Xiao Jingchen scoffed, and with a lift of his arm, he threw out a
            punch. The magnificent spiritual power formed a giant golden fist
            sign.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fist sign lashed out, threatening to rip the sky open and tear
            the ground apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing that, Murong Xuan drew out the Blazing Sun in retaliation. A
            surge of crimson sword qi, which contained a tremendous fire wave,
            surged out at his opponent.
          </p>
          <p>These two forces clashed and exploded with a bang</p>
          <p>
            As a result of the explosion, massive amounts of dust swirled
            skyward from all over the volcano.
          </p>
          <p>This commotion had drawn quite a number of people’s attention.</p>
          <p>“What a powerful energy wave. Who’s battling whom?”</p>
          <p>
            “With such energy, I reckon it has to be top-notch Sage Rulers, who
            are close to the Boundary Emperor Realm.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s go up there and have a look. If they are sky-prides, we have
            to take note of such top-notch sky-prides.”
          </p>
          <p>The people made a beeline toward that volcanic crater.</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, a far distance away, Chu Kuangren, who was having a
            shut-eye abruptly opened his eyes. “Oh? Murong Xuan has engaged in a
            battle. This energy... It’s him, alright.”
          </p>
          <p>Back at the volcanic crater.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Xiao Jingchen’s battle had already reached its
            climax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of them were the most top-notch sky-prides, so their combat
            strengths were exceptional. This was especially true for Xiao
            Jingchen. His Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique was ranked second
            among the Three-Thousand Daoist Physiques, and there were only a few
            physiques in current times that could match its sheer power. Adding
            that to his Sage Ruler cultivation level, the combat strength that
            he could unleash was almost near a Boundary Emperor’s level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that, Xiao Jingchen was shocked that he could not defeat
            Murong Xuan in one go.
          </p>
          <p>
            He knew that his opponent only had the Crimson Sun Daoist Physique,
            which may be a top-notch Daoist Physique, but it was only ranked at
            the lowest class. There was no way it could compete with his
            Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique. Yet, the combat strength that
            Murong Xuan was able to unleash was not far off from his.
          </p>
          <p>This finding took him by surprise.</p>
          <p>“What’s up with this guy? How does he have such amazing power?”</p>
          <p>“Hold up. It’s not the Daoist Physique... but the technique!”</p>
          <p>
            “This person’s techniques are amazing. Moreover, these techniques
            are all compatible with his Daoist Physique. That’s why he can
            produce such impressive combat strength.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Xiao Jingchen had good insight, and very soon, he figured out the
            key behind his opponent’s prowess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, it shocked him to the core. His own cultivation
            techniques were extremely superb as it was from an Emperor
            Scripture. Yet, although Murong Xuan’s Daoist Physique was much
            inferior to his, the former was still able to hold his own in this
            battle. This proved that the techniques that his opponent cultivates
            are more superior to his! n0𝑣𝑬𝐥𝑢𝗌𝒃.𝕔0𝐦
          </p>
          <p>
            He deduced that his opponent must have cultivated an Emperor
            Scripture too, and it should be one of the most top-class Emperor
            Scriptures.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the audience grew in number, Xiao Jingchen began to feel a little
            uneasy about not being able to take down his opponent even after
            such a long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that a great Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique host like
            him had let a far weaker Crimson Sun Daoist Physique bring the fight
            to him like this... Would that not mean that he was a weakling?!
          </p>
          <p>“It seems that you’ve left me with no choice!”</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>“It seems like you’ve left me with no choice.”</p>
          <p>
            A cold gaze shot out from Xiao Jingchen’s eyes, and he was seen
            retracting his pike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just when Murong Xuan thought his opponent was ceasing the battle, a
            terrifying Emperor’s Aura erupted from Xiao Jingchen’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sheer power of this aura shook Murong Xuan back several hundred
            meters.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This aura is...” A grim expression etched on Murong Xuan’s face as
            he stared at Xiao Jingchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was when a long black spear started to slowly take form in his
            opponent’s hand. That spear was the source of this Emperor’s Aura!
          </p>
          <p>It was an Emperor Weapon!!</p>
          <p>Everybody watching the battle was shocked.</p>
          <p>“An Emperor Weapon! That’s an Emperor Weapon!”</p>
          <p>
            “I didn’t expect him to have an Emperor Weapon. This man not only
            has the Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique, but he even has an
            Emperor Weapon in his arsenal!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know this guy. He’s the Young Master of the Bai clan in Nine
            Heavens, Xiao Jingchen!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Tsk tsk, the Bai clan... an archaic clan. Even so, it’s way too
            much for a sky-pride to be in possession of an Emperor Weapon, isn’t
            it?”
          </p>
          <p>“Perhaps the weapon was his own Opportunity of Fortune...”</p>
          <p>The crowd began to exchange their opinions.</p>
          <p>
            Besides Emperor Road’s local sky-prides, the crowd also consisted of
            a number of sky-prides from the Nine Heavens and Firmament Star.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quite a few of them had placings on the Soaring Dragon Leaderboard.
            n0𝒱𝖊𝔩𝗎𝓈𝑏.𝗰0𝐌
          </p>
          <p>For instance, Zhan Hongying, Tuba, and others.</p>
          <p>
            When Zhan Hongying saw Xiao Jingchen pull out an Emperor Weapon, she
            could not help but pout. “Isn’t this guy a little too unreasonable?
            Not only is he the host of the Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique,
            but he even has an Emperor Weapon. He is clearly bullying his
            opponent at this point.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Tsk tsk. It looks like that it really depends on who this Daoist
            Physique falls into the hands of. This Heavenly Golden Imperial
            Physique is an absolute waste in the hands of this Xiao Jingchen. He
            can’t even beat a Crimson Sun Daoist Physique. I reckon he must be
            the most useless Heavenly Imperial Physique that history has ever
            seen.” Tuba also could not resist mocking him.
          </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, Xiao Jingchen could not care less.</p>
          <p>
            He held onto the Emperor Weapon while tremendous amounts of Heavenly
            Golden qi surged behind him, turning into a giant Heavenly Imperial
            Avatar.
          </p>
          <p>“Destroy him!!”</p>
          <p>
            Xiao Jingchen cried out and thrust the Emperor Weapon in his grip
            toward Murong Xuan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The might of the Emperor Weapon and Heavenly Imperial instantly
            locked onto Murong Xuan!
          </p>
          <p>“You want me to admit defeat just like that? Think again!!”</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan growled, and searing flames continued flowing out the
            surface of his body.
          </p>
          <p>A more dazzling flame coursed on his Blazing Sun Sword.</p>
          <p>
            The moment he struck out his sword, the scorching sword qi
            transformed almost into a sea of fire, which shrouded the horizon
            and surged violently toward his opponent’s spear strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, it was never that easy to fend off an Emperor Weapon’s
            might.
          </p>
          <p>
            The spear energy pierced through the sea of fire and rushed to
            Murong Xuan!

          <p>
            Right at this perilous moment, an incredibly terrifying, bitingly
            cold energy surrounded the entire place.
          </p>
          <p>“This energy... It’s him!!”</p>
          <p>
            Zhang Hongying, Tuba, and the rest of the Firmament Star sky-prides’
            eyes narrowed. They stared toward the far side all at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            What met their sights was a sword ray which pelted up into the sky
            and radiated with magnificent brilliance!
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword qi was so right that within an instant, it crossed
            thousands of kilometers and landed on Xiao Jingchen’s spear light!
          </p>
          <p>In the blink of an eye, the spear light was shattered!</p>
          <p>
            Yet, the sword qi retained its piercing momentum, surging further
            forward with force. Its aim was on Xiao Jingchen!
          </p>
          <p>“Chu Kuangren!!”</p>
          <p>Terror was seen in Xiao Jingchen’s eyes.</p>
          <p>
            In face of that incoming sword qi, he let out a roar that urged his
            spiritual power to the extreme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the Heavenly Imperial Avatar’s hands grabbed at that sword qi!
          </p>
          <p>
            However, at the moment of contact, the Heavenly Imperial Avatar’s
            hands were both chopped off!
          </p>
          <p>
            In a split second, this powerful Daoist Transformation that was
            unique to the Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique stood no chance to
            this sword qi!
          </p>
          <p>“Break!!”</p>
          <p>Xiao Jingchen thrust his Emperor Weapon out!</p>
          <p>
            The sword clashed with the spear with a loud clang, and an
            incredibly strong impact erupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, Xiao Jingchen was blasted out several kilometers before
            smashing onto a faraway mountain range. He was utterly humiliated.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was just a single sword technique, yet he could not defend
            himself from it at all, and he was mortally wounded within an
            instant!
          </p>
          <p>
            He raised his hand to shield his eyes and stared into the distance,
            only to see a white-robed figure with black hair walking toward him
            across the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a peerless yet imposing stance and sharp, domineering eyes, he
            was the demon that had been haunting Xiao Jingchen!
          </p>
          <p>“Chu Kuangren!!”</p>
          <p>“It really is him. He has come to the Emperor Road too!”</p>
          <p>Xiao Jingchen was not surprised.</p>
          <p>
            Still, he had spent an entire year focusing on his cultivation,
            improving by quite a great margin, yet he was not able to withstand
            even one sword technique from his opponent. This was huge of a blow
            for him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zhan Hongying, Touba, and the others watched Chu Kuangren with
            terror-stricken expressions as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for those local sky-prides of Emperor Road who did not know Chu
            Kuangren, they were utterly astonished when they saw how heavily
            injured Xiao Jingchen was in a single sword technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is he for real? That was the Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique, yet
            he beat it with only one sword technique??”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Who is this guy? How does he have such terrifying combat strength?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t think even outlawed sky-prides have that kind of power.”
          </p>
          <p>
            All the sky-prides at the scene began to discuss what they had just
            seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Heavenly Golden Imperial Physique had a great reputation.
            Besides, Xiao Jingchen also had an Emperor Weapon in his possession,
            so it would be unrealistic even for an outlawed sky-pride to defeat
            him with one hit alone.
          </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, Chu Kuangren did it.</p>
          <p>
            Just like that, he stood over thousands of kilometers out, threw out
            a sword strike, and effortlessly wounded his opponent!

            “I didn’t want to interfere with your battle with Murong Xuan.
            However, pulling out an Emperor Weapon in battle is just too much.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren remarked calmly as he stared at Xiao Jingchen with a
            bitter coldness in his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even him, the owner of several Emperor Weapons, would never have
            pulled them out when fighting a fellow sky-pride.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, none of his fellow sky-prides justified the need for him
            to use his Emperor Weapons either.
          </p>
          <p>“Chu Kuangren, what the hell do you want?”</p>
          <p>
            Xiao Jingchen took a deep breath. He knew that he was not Chu
            Kuangren’s match despite having an Emperor Weapon with him.
          </p>
          <p>“That Supreme Elixir, we want it.”</p>
          <p>“Alright.”</p>
          <p>
            Xiao Jingchen nodded. He expressed no intention of competing with
            Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>“At least you know your place.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren could not be bothered to pursue this matter further
            with a guy like him.
          </p>
          <p>Just then, a red light shot into the sky.</p>
          <p>
            That red light approached the crowd with great speed, and a ruthless
            domineering aura got closer as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those with slightly weaker cultivation were already breaking into a
            cold sweat.
          </p>
          <p>
            A curvy, redhead woman in bright red armor arrived atop of the
            crowd.
          </p>
          <p>
            This woman commanded an atmosphere of reverence. She scanned the
            surroundings with her pretty bright eyes, with which nobody dared to
            look at her directly.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s her! Bai Hongyu from the Bai clan!”</p>
          <p>
            “Bai Hongyu, one of the outlawed sky-prides. Her combat strength has
            reached such an unattainable level even for the older generation
            elites.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems like she has come for the Enchanted Forest Realm as well.”
          </p>
          <p>The crowd was extremely surprised at her presence.</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren was scrutinizing this Bai Hongyu lady in
            front of him while his Eye of Revelation worked its magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her cultivation level, techniques, and so on were projected before
            Chu Kuangren’s eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the first-ever outlawed sky-pride that Chu Kuangren had
            encountered, her strength was truly commendable. She was even
            stronger than some of the Boundary Emperors.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Interesting. This outlawed sky-pride might finally be the one who
            could surprise me.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren’s mouth raised into a grin.</p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu’s gaze fell upon Chu Kuangren as well, and a look of
            surprise flashed in her beautiful eyes. “So you’re Chu Kuangren?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            She had heard Xiao Jingchen mentioning Chu Kuangren before back in
            the Nine Heavens.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, that is me!”</p>
          <p>“I hope you’re ready to take on one of my attacks!”</p>
          <p>
            As soon as Bai Hongyu finished her sentence, a red light circled
            her, and tremendous spiritual power gushed out continuously from her
            body.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Not to mention one attack, even with tens or hundreds of your
            attacks, I’d still be standing. So what can you do to me?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren crossed his arms and stood arrogantly with his black
            hair swaying to the rhythm of the breeze.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Very well. I’d like to see how powerful a Supreme Sage really is!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu cried out in her feminine voice, then lifted one arm to
            amass spiritual qi from the surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once she placed down her palm, horrifying strength qi spread out in
            all directions, transforming into a giant red palm print, which
            struck down from the sky above!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>
            Chapter 536: Why Don’t You Have A Taste Of My Attack As Well, The
            Enchanted Forest Realm Opens
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            As soon as Bai Hongyu stuck out her palm, a red palm sign came
            hurling towards Chu Kuangren while its devastating palm qi swept out
            in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its overbearing energy instantly enveloped Chu Kuangren’s
            surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren had no reaction to that powerful attack. He
            simply stood where he was and channeled a surge of his mind power to
            create an invisible barrier!
          </p>
          <p>
            Before it could reach within three meters of Chu Kuangren, Bai
            Hongyu’s palm qi was repelled by the barrier, and it dispersed into
            the surroundings instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an instant, the ground surrounding Chu Kuangren sank. Large
            amounts of smoke and dust were swept outward.
          </p>
          <p>
            The onlooking cultivators’ expression changed a little as they
            quickly backed off from the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What a terrifying surge of palm qi. This attack alone is already on
            par with a Boundary Emperor’s strength.”
          </p>
          <p>“Is this the power of the outlaw sky-prides?”</p>
          <p>
            “The term ‘outlaw’ is often used for a certain category of
            sky-prides whose power greatly exceeds the comprehension of the
            ordinary people. The name really lives up to the reputation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowd of onlooking cultivators looked at that red figure in the
            sky with amazement in their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu stood in the air with red light swirling around her and
            bursts of spiritual power emanating from her body. She gave off an
            invincible aura.
          </p>
          <p>“An outlaw sky-pride? It doesn’t seem special to me.”</p>
          <p>At that moment, a voice came from amidst the clouds of dust.</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked towards its source. Once the dust had dispersed,
            they eventually saw a white figure standing proudly on the spot,
            unmoved.
          </p>
          <p>It was Chu Kuangren, who was completely unharmed.</p>
          <p>
            The surrounding area around him had completely sunk downwards and
            formed a gigantic crater of several hundred kilometers wide with
            countless cracks spreading outwards from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the ground three meters around him did not suffer any
            damages at all.
          </p>
          <p>“He managed to block it!”</p>
          <p>“How did he do that? I didn’t even see his counterattack.”</p>
          <p>“This person’s abilities are far beyond our comprehension!”</p>
          <p>
            If Bai Hongyu gave everyone the impression that she was strong,
            terrifying, and not easily defeated, then to them, Chu Kuangren was
            like a bottomless abyss — unpredictable and mysterious!
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu glanced at Chu Kuangren with fear in her eyes. “It seems
            the Supreme Sage really lives up to the rumors. Xiao Jingchen, let’s
            leave!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing that the Enchanted Forest Realm was going to open, she did
            not wish to bother herself with Chu Kuangren any longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            If she were to get injured now, she would be at a great disadvantage
            when dealing with the other outlaw sky-prides in there.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Coming and going as you please, huh? Aren’t you taking me a little
            too lightly?”
          </p>
          <p>
            At this moment, Chu Kuangren chuckled. A chilling aura immediately
            spread forth and enveloped the whole area before locking onto Bai
            Hongyu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu’s eyes trembled upon hearing his words. “What’s the
            matter? Looking for a fight before the Forest Realm opens?”
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            “Oh, that’s not it. I’m just wondering since I’ve taken a hit from
            you, why don’t you have a taste of my attack as well?”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a lift of his hand, spiritual power started to surge within Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>Then, he struck his palm lightly into the air.</p>
          <p>
            An incredibly horrifying palm sign, which contained a sense of
            sorrow, appeared in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every witnessing cultivator suddenly felt they were overwhelmed with
            a deep sense of sadness and grief, causing their fighting spirit to
            greatly diminish.
          </p>
          <p>It was the Emperor Technique, Palm of Sorrow!</p>
          <p>
            Shocked by that attack, Bai Hongyu moved both her arms, and large
            amounts of spiritual power poured out from the palm of her hands. An
            overbearing surge of Daoist Rhyme gathered in the void to form a
            gigantic red seal that was hundreds of meters wide before crashing
            towards the incoming Palm of Sorrow. “Divine Bai Clan Seal!”
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as the two surges of energy collided with a bang, multiple
            white cracks appeared as if the void was burst open.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tremendous amounts of shockwaves immediately spread out, sending Bai
            Hongyu flying several hundred meters away. Eventually, she crashed
            into a mountain.
          </p>
          <p>That mountain immediately exploded!</p>
          <p>Everyone was baffled by what they saw.</p>
          <p>
            In their eyes, the outlaw sky-prides were cultivators who possessed
            a level of strength beyond their reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren just sent an outlaw sky-pride flying with a
            single palm technique!
          </p>
          <p>The combat strength displayed was simply unfathomable for them.</p>
          <p>
            Even Xiao Jingchen was shocked as well. “I can’t believe even Bai
            Hongyu is nothing to him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Far away, Bai Hongyu was seen rushing out from the ruins of that
            mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bright red armor she had on her was radiating bursts of red
            light and trembling violently.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was only after a while that the trembling had disappeared. Bai
            Hongyu looked at Chu Kuangren, not knowing how she should feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            If she did not have that armor equipped for protection earlier, that
            palm technique would definitely deal her a devastating blow!
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s combat strength was far beyond what she had expected.
          </p>
          <p>‘Is a Supreme Sage really that terrifying?!’</p>
          <p>
            “Ha! You truly are a sky-pride from a large orthodoxy. You have a
            lot of treasures at your disposal. Even the armor on you is a
            Boundary Emperor Weapon.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren looked at Bai Hongyu and uttered with amazement.</p>
          <p>
            “You used a technique that affects one’s mental state. How are you
            related to the Seven Emotions Sect?” Bai Hongyu replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, the Seven Emotions Sect? This is the second time I’ve heard of
            this name.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren mumbled.</p>
          <p>
            When he had used the Raging Gods Fist to defeat the Seven-colored
            Swordsmen at the Wu clan, they also made the same remark as well —
            questioning whether he was one of the cultivators from the Seven
            Emotions Sect.
          </p>
          <p>Now, Bai Hongyu has brought up the name of that sect again.</p>
          <p>This piqued his interest a little.</p>
          <p>
            However, before Chu Kuangren could ask any further, a strange energy
            wave suddenly appeared from the void.
          </p>

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>Seas of clouds suddenly started to gather in the skies.</p>
          <p>Out of nowhere, a large forest appeared in the skies!</p>
          <p>Everyone became incredibly excited upon seeing that!</p>
          <p>“The Enchanted Forest Realm is open!”</p>
          <p>Someone yelled.</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at the extraordinary occurrence in the skies and
            immediately rushed towards it. One by one, they entered the
            Enchanted Forest Realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu glanced at Chu Kuangren and said, “Chu Kuangren, now that
            the Forest Realm has opened, our fight will have to wait!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, she turned into a red ray of light, dashing towards the skies
            as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Xiao Jingchen, Zhan Hongying, Touba, and the others did the same
            too.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Enchanted Forest Realm is now open, Sect Leader. It’s time we
            head inside there as well.”
          </p>
          <p>Murong Xuan said.</p>
          <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
          <p>
            Along with the other two, Chu Kuangren entered the Enchanted Forest
            Realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon entering the Forest Realm, everyone was greeted by lush and
            undulating forests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides that, Chu Kuangren could also sense the dense spiritual qi
            fluctuations in the surroundings, which was dozens of times greater
            than the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, any cultivation practice conducted here would be
            several times more efficient than the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>“What a splendid environment for practicing one’s cultivation.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren uttered with wonder.</p>
          <p>
            However, the Enchanted Forest Realm would only open for around half
            a month every time. Once that period ended, it would immediately
            return into the void and open again after several thousand years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many cultivators would not mind living in such an environment if it
            were not for that very reason.
          </p>

          <p>Shang Qingxue said excitedly.</p>
          <p>
            She knew all too well that Chu Kuangren’s Treasure Locating Skill
            would be extremely useful in a secret realm like this.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright. Let’s see if there are any treasures nearby.”</p>
          <p>
            The moment Chu Kuangren activated his Treasure Locating Skill, he
            received a horde of information about the treasures within a radius
            of thousands of kilometers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow. This Enchanted Forest Realm is really full of wonders. It
            looks like quite a lot of treasures are waiting to be found here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren was slightly surprised to find that no less than a
            hundred top-tiered Sage-grade treasures alone were detected within a
            thousand-kilometer radius from him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, these treasures were of little use to the Chu Kuangren and
            others by now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, he shifted his focus to the Boundary Emperor-grade and even
            the Emperor-grade treasures instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Got it. There’s a Boundary Emperor-grade item three thousand
            kilometers south from here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “If we keep going straight for a thousand kilometers, there’s a
            Boundary Emperor Grade spirit mine.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Take a look at this. There are Primitive Elite Swordgrass
            twenty-one thousand kilometers from here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren chuckled as he led both Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan
            on a looting spree within the Enchanted Forest Realm.

          <h4>
            Chapter 537: The Primitive Elite Swordgrass, Three Sky-Prides, The
            Sword Daoist
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Every sky-pride was looking for treasures within the Enchanted
            Forest Realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren had already obtained quite a lot of items
            within this Forest Realm alongside Shang Qingxue and Murong Xuan.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this moment in time, they were heading towards the location of an
            Emperor-grade treasure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Atop of a mountain, a green sword-shaped plant was standing against
            the wind.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the wind breezed past that Supreme Elixir, it carried along
            with it the fine streaks of sword qi from the plant and slashed the
            surrounding plants into pieces wherever it went.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some time, that Supreme Elixir was surrounded by several
            cultivators. There was a sense of sharpness emanating from them as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>Most of them were sword cultivators!</p>
          <p>
            “This is no doubt the Primitive Elite Swordgrass! This Enchanted
            Forest Realm is truly extraordinary for being able to produce such a
            wonderful treasure.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Seeing that it’s filled with countless Opportunities of Fortune,
            the Enchanted Forest Realm really lives up to its name. I’m still in
            awe of the fact that it can produce Emperor Grade Supreme Elixirs
            like this Primitive Elite Swordgrass right here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Rumor has it that besides its ability to purify one’s sword qi,
            this swordgrass also contains a powerful Daoist Rhyme that can
            enable the user to cultivate the powerful Primitive Elite Sword
            Physique. Although it is no match to the mighty Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart, this Supreme Elixir is undoubtedly a great
            Opportunity of Fortune to any sword cultivator! ”
          </p>
          <p>
            “However, this plant is now surrounded by sword qi, making it hard
            for us to approach it.”
          </p>
          <p>“If that’s the case, then may the best man win.”</p>
          <p>
            One of the swordsmen surrounding the swordgrass could not wait any
            longer. He immediately walked towards the Primitive Elite
            Swordgrass.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he got within thirty meters of the swordgrass, the sword leaves
            moved slightly, unleashing a silver-white streak of sword qi towards
            him.
          </p>
          <p>That sword qi was incredibly sharp.</p>
          <p>
            The expression of the approaching swordsman changed slightly. Then,
            he drew his sword and slashed forth.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, a clang sounded as that swordsman’s sword immediately broke
            into pieces, and a bloodstained line appeared on his neck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blood gushed out from that swordsman’s neck, and he was beheaded
            right where he stood.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What a powerful sword qi. It’s at least the level of a Sage Ruler.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sure enough, taking this swordgrass is no simple task. This
            swordgrass has a soul as well, so it’s a remarkable swordsman
            itself!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The surrounding swordsmen looked at that swordgrass with fear in
            their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>At that time, several figures had arrived from a distance.</p>
          <p>
            Powerful surges of sword qi emanated from these people as they
            looked at the swordgrass with a coveting gaze.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the people from Qin clan, Wang clan, and the Heavenly Divine
            Sword Sect.”

            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            “Look over there, I think the person in front of that group is the
            Qin Feng of the Qin clan. Rumor has it that this person’s power is
            second only to Qin Tianchen. He’s a top-notch sky-pride whose
            strength is almost at the level of an outlaw sky-pride, and his
            combat strength is incredibly close to a Boundary Emperor’s level.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “And the young man in white beside him is the Heavenly Divine Sword
            Sect’s Mo Yifan, who’s also a renowned top-notch sky-pride.”
          </p>
          <p>“Wang Xu of the Wang clan is also here.”</p>
          <p>
            The arrival of the top-notch sky-prides stirred a discussion among
            the surrounding crowd.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, as if sensing a greater threat, the sword qi emanating
            from Primitive Elite Swordgrass became even stronger and denser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its sword qi surged in the air and formed a thirty-meter radius
            sword domain around it. This made none of the swordsmen dare to
            approach it hastily.
          </p>
          <p>
            The few top-notch sky-prides stood in the air, glancing at the
            swordgrass with a strange look in their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “To have such a dense aura, this is quite a remarkable swordgrass.
            If I can obtain and refine it for myself, my Primitive Elite Sword
            Physique will definitely rise to the next level.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wang Xu of the Wang clan looked at the swordgrass with a burning
            gaze.
          </p>
          <p>
            He possessed the Primitive Elite Sword Physique, one of the known
            Three-Thousand Physiques that was second only to the Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart in terms of sword Dao. If he could refine that
            Primitive Elite Swordgrass, his Primitive Elite Sword Physique would
            reach a higher level. Then, it could even contend with the Exquisite
            Nine Orifices Sword Heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was why Wang Xu’s desire for that swordgrass was the strongest
            among the three of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, he knew that the other top-notch sky-prides would never
            allow him to obtain that swordgrass that easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Fellow sword cultivators, I humbly request that everyone allow me
            to obtain this swordgrass for my Daoist Physique’s sake. I shall
            greatly reward everyone for this generosity in the future.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wang Xu gave the top-notch sky-prides from the Heavenly Divine Sword
            Sect and the Qin clan a fist salute.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing that, Qin Feng let out a contemptuous grin. “Are you
            kidding me? Do you expect us to give up on this swordgrass just
            because you say so? Impossible.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No one knows what’ll happen in the future, but this swordgrass
            before us is an Opportunity of Fortune waiting to be obtained.”
          </p>
          <p>Mo Yifan, the young man in white added.</p>
          <p>
            “If that’s the case, I’d take it that both of you have no respect
            for the Wang clan.”
          </p>
          <p>Wang Xu’s expression turned a little grim.</p>
          <p>
            “Wang clan? Not to mention the fact that the Wang clan is only a
            branch clan in the Emperor Road, do you think my Qin clan will be
            afraid of your clan’s main branch?”
          </p>
          <p>Qin Feng uttered proudly.</p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. It seems like someone has gotten a little arrogant just
            because his Qin clan has produced someone like Qin Tianchen,” Wang
            Xu replied coldly.
          </p>
          <p>Qin Tianchen was the Qin clan’s outlaw sky-pride.</p>
          <p>
            Rumor has it that he was the reincarnation of a Great Emperor as his
            combat strength was so powerful that it exceeded all of his peers.
            Even among the outlaw sky-prides, he was considered one of the more
            terrifying individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So what if that’s true? My clan brother’s peerless strength will
            definitely earn him a place as an Emperor in the future!”
          </p>
          <p>
            At the mention of Qin Tianchen, Qin Feng had a look of admiration on
            his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright, Brother Wang. Stop thinking that we’ll give up just for
            you. If you want the swordgrass, then we shall let our abilities do
            the talking instead!”
          </p>
          <p>
            After Mo Yifan spoke, an invisible qi sword suddenly appeared in his
            grasp, and he struck a slash towards the Primitive Elite Swordgrass!
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>

                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            The invisible qi sword’s attack unleashed its dense surge of sword
            qi to form a storm, which instantly destroyed the sword qi domain
            surrounding the Primitive Elite Swordgrass.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s the Heavenly Divine Sword Qi from the Heavenly Divine Sword
            Sect!”
          </p>
          <p>A sword cultivator uttered in amazement.</p>
          <p>
            As one of the orthodoxies that specialized in swordsmanship in
            Emperor Road, the Heavenly Divine Sword Sect could be said as second
            only to the Sword Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their Heavenly Divine Sword Qi was also one of the most well-known
            sword Dao techniques in Emperor Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            When his sword qi broke through the swordgrass’s domain, Mo Yifan’s
            figure immediately dashed towards it. Covering his hand with a layer
            of sword qi, he reached out and attempted to grab the swordgrass.
          </p>
          <p>However, a streak of sword qi suddenly attacked him.</p>
          <p>It was Wang Xu who had intervened.</p>
          <p>
            Facing Wang Xu’s sword qi, Mo Yifan did not dare let his guard down,
            so he cast his Heavenly Divine Sword Qi to block it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is that the Primitive Elite Sword Physique that’s second only to
            the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart? I’ve been dying to find out
            how powerful it is. Bring it on!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Mo Yifan knew that he had to defeat the remaining sky-prides at the
            scene to obtain the swordgrass.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as his Heavenly Divine Sword Qi was released, a dense surge
            of spiritual power erupted to form a bright sword ray that headed
            towards Wang Xu.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Wang Xu retaliated with the colorful sword in his grasp,
            unleashing an attack that contained the Five Ways energy.
          </p>
          <p>“Thousand Strikes of Gold!”</p>
          <p>
            Countless streaks of golden sword qi combined and formed a three
            hundred meters long sword shadow, which clashed with the Heavenly
            Divine Sword Qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the other two sky-prides were in a fight, Qin Feng quickly
            headed towards the swordgrass.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, the moment he moved, Wang Xu and Mo Yifan immediately shifted
            their target to him instead. Both of them unleashed a sword
            technique towards him at the same time, separating him from the
            swordgrass. n0𝔳𝖊𝔩𝓊𝓈𝔟.𝓒0𝑚
          </p>
          <p>
            The three great sword Dao sky-prides stood at three different
            places, facing each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It looks like I can’t get this swordgrass without taking down the
            two of you first.”
          </p>
          <p>“I intend to do the same as well.”</p>
          <p>
            The three of them stood in the air as three different sword-based
            Daoist Rhymes continued colliding in the void.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their surroundings seemed like it was filled with an invisible
            razor-sharp aura, causing the other sky-prides not daring to get
            near.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone had their eyes on the fight between the top-notch
            sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just when the three sky-prides were about to fight, an aura that was
            even stronger and colder than the three of them erupted from afar
            and enveloped the whole area.
          </p>
          <p>
            The three great sky-prides’ expressions changed instinctively when
            they sensed that aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two streams of sword rays swooped in. One of them was wearing a long
            golden robe, and the other had surges of sword qi and an
            incomparably strong Sword-based Daoist Rhyme swirling around him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the swords in the grasps of the sword cultivators at the scene
            started trembling uncontrollably under the might of that Daoist
            Rhyme.
          </p>
          <p>Everybody was petrified at the sudden occurrence.</p>
          <p>
            “This Daoist Rhyme. It’s the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart!!”
          </p>
          <p>“It’s the Sword Tribe’s Daoist!”</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>“It’s the Sword Daoist!!”</p>
          <p>
            The expressions of the three sword Dao sky-prides, who were just
            about to fight, changed upon seeing the Sword Daoist’s arrival.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although they were top-notch sky-prides, there was still a gap in
            combat strength between them and an outlaw sky-pride like Sword
            Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>“I didn’t think that guy would be interested too.”</p>
          <p>“Now, this is a little troublesome.”</p>
          <p>The sword Dao sky-prides looked at the Sword Daoist with fear.</p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, the Sword Daoist looked at Wang Xu and the others
            apathetically, as if he was looking at a mere few ants.
          </p>
          <p>“This Primitive Elite Swordgrass is mine.”</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist uttered.</p>
          <p>
            He spoke in a manner as if those sword Dao sky-prides were nothing
            to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Realistically speaking, he had no reason to take the other sword Dao
            sky-prides seriously. After all, he was one of the most outstanding
            sky-prides in the Emperor Road who possessed the Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sword Daoist, aren’t you being a bit tyrannical? This Primitive
            Elite Swordgrass doesn’t belong to you just because you said so.”
          </p>
          <p>Qin Feng could not resist asking.</p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing that, the Sword Daoist gathered sword qi on his fingers
            and unleashed it towards him.
          </p>
          <p>
            A golden streak of sword qi that carried a chilling Sword-based
            Daoist Rhyme instantly locked onto Qin Feng!
          </p>
          <p>
            Qin Feng’s pupils shrank. With a low cry, he unleashed a strike in
            return. However, he was forcefully pushed back by that attack, and
            his hand that was gripping the sword could not stop trembling from
            the bleeding crack between his thumb and index finger.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You can’t even hold your own against a single attack from me, yet
            you still have the nerve to complain?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist replied as surges of sword qi swirled around him,
            which made him look like a sword deity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having entered the Enchanted Forest Realm with Sword Daoist, Jian
            Changfeng was secretly stunned by what happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Just a mere clone of his already possesses such power! This Sword
            Daoist is indeed an outlaw sky-pride. He’s terrifying!’
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘In terms of sword Dao, perhaps my Master is the only one who can
            overpower him.’
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sword Daoist, if my clan brother is here, he’ll never allow you to
            behave in such a tyrannical manner!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Qin Feng knew he was no match for the Sword Daoist, so he brought up
            the name of the Qin clan’s outlaw sky-pride in hopes of salvaging
            his crumbling reputation.
          </p>
          <p>
            A hint of surprise flashed across the Sword Daoist’s eyes. “I
            suppose you’re referring to Qin Tianchen? Has he not come to the
            Enchanted Forest Realm as well?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. I’ll have you know, my clan brother is currently in
            closed-door meditation. If it weren’t for that, do you think you’d
            be able to flaunt your power here?”
          </p>

          <p>
            “Since Qin Tianchen is not here, how did you get the courage to
            speak to me like that?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist snorted before raising his hand and unleashed
            another sword technique.
          </p>
          <p>Surges of sword qi swept outward like a storm!</p>
          <p>
            Enveloped within the storm, Qin Feng yelled and frantically swung
            his sword, continuously releasing streaks of sword qi to resist the
            storm. However, his efforts were futile.
          </p>
          <p>The sword qi inside the storm soon grew denser and stronger.</p>
          <p>
            Eventually, countless streaks of sword qi closed in on Qin Feng as
            large amounts of sword qi appeared on his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few moments after that, there were a dozen deep cuts all over Qin
            Feng’s body, and he fell onto the ground, bleeding profusely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scene made the surrounding sword cultivators look at the Sword
            Daoist with awe in their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            He could critically injure a top-notch sky-pride just like that.
            Such a display of combat strength truly lived up to the name of an
            outlaw sky-pride.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it...”</p>
          <p>
            Qin Feng raised his hand as he looked at the Sword Daoist with fear
            in his eyes. He did not expect the difference in their strengths to
            be so great!
          </p>
          <p>
            The outlaw sky-prides and ordinary sky-prides were truly on two
            different levels of existence.
          </p>
          <p>“For Qin Tianchen’s sake, I shall let you live.”</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist glanced at Qin Feng and said.</p>
          <p>
            Following that, his cold gaze soon swept across everyone around.
            “Does anyone else wish to obtain this Primitive Elite Swordgrass?”
          </p>
          <p>No one dared to respond.</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist’s display of strength had greatly shocked everyone
            at the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart really does enhance the
            sword Dao abilities by a lot. If he can overpower any sword
            cultivator, we’re definitely no match for him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “As long as we’re sword cultivators, our strength will naturally be
            overpowered by the Sword Daoist’s presence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sigh. Apart from the outlaw sky-prides, the Sword Daoist’s strength
            is unmatched among the younger generation. If he manages to obtain
            this Primitive Elite Swordgrass, there’s no telling how powerful
            he’ll eventually become. He might have a great chance of becoming an
            Emperor in this epoch.”
          </p>
          <p>Everyone secretly thought.</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist had overpowered every single sky-pride in the whole
            of Emperor Road with his strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            After looking around and noticing that no one dared to go against
            him, the Sword Daoist shifted his gaze towards the Primitive Elite
            Swordgrass nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            That Supreme Elixir would greatly benefit him, especially his clone.
          </p>
          <p>
            He knew that this body of his was only a clone, which meant that it
            could not activate the full strength of the Exquisite Nine Orifices
            Sword Heart. If he could manage to refine the Primitive Elite
            Swordgrass, this clone of his would possess the Primitive Elite
            Sword Physique. Adding that to the power of the Daoist Rhyme from
            the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, the combat strength of this
            clone would be on par with his real self.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon thinking of this, the Sword Daoist delightfully reached out to
            grab the Primitive Elite Swordgrass. n0𝗏𝓔𝔩𝓤𝓈𝑩.𝚌0𝓂
          </p>
          <p>“I’m afraid I can’t allow you to touch it.”</p>
          <p>At this moment, a laid-back voice came from the void.</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>

                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Following that, an incredibly powerful aura — more terrifying than
            the Sword Daoist’s — immediately enveloped the whole area!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the might of that aura, each swordsman’s sword uncontrollably
            broke free from its grasps. All the swords levitated densely in the
            air, as if they were welcoming the presence of the overlord of
            swords!!
          </p>
          <p>“This surge of aura, can it be...”</p>
          <p>
            Seemingly recalling something, the Sword Daoist’s deep gaze shifted
            into the distance.
          </p>
          <p>Everyone else, too, looked towards the source of that aura.</p>
          <p>
            All they saw was a white-robed young man with black hair slowly
            approaching under the swords’ respectful welcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            The person who arrived had a handsome appearance and otherworldly
            air about him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist snorted when he saw the person. “How dare you use
            swordsmanship before the likes of me! Do you know who you’re messing
            with?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword-based Daoist Rhyme that erupted from his body instantly
            enveloped the surrounding area, attempting to seize control over the
            swords that were levitating in the air around Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no matter how much Daoist Rhyme he cast, the levitating
            swords around Chu Kuangren did not budge at all!
          </p>
          <p>Everyone gulped.</p>
          <p>
            “The Sword Daoist has been overpowered by someone else in terms of
            sword Dao?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “By the heavens, who the h*ll is that person? How does he have such
            a powerful sword Dao?”
          </p>
          <p>“This is unbelievable...”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone knew that the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was the
            best Daoist Physique in terms of sword Dao. Hence, as one who had
            that physique and a strong brought-up from the Sword Tribe, Sword
            Daoist’s level of cultivation in terms of sword Dao should be
            unmatched.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the older generation of sword cultivators would find it hard to
            suppress him with their strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, that commonly known worldview was just shattered by Chu
            Kuangren!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even among the younger generation, the Sword Daoist was not
            invincible in sword Dao cultivation!
          </p>
          <p>Now, there was someone else who was even more skilled than him!</p>
          <p>“Master...”</p>
          <p>
            Looking at Chu Kuangren, whose arrival was welcomed by countless
            levitating swords, Jian Changfeng could not help but look at him
            with strong admiration.
          </p>
          <p>However, he managed to hide that expression in time.</p>
          <p>
            Since the Sword Daoist’s attention was on Chu Kuangren, he did not
            notice Jian Changfeng’s weird behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I can’t believe this guy’s Sword-based Daoist Rhyme has reached
            such a terrifying level.” The Sword Daoist looked at Chu Kuangren
            sternly.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was well aware that Chu Kuangren possessed the Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart. Even so, there should be a difference in
            strength between two fellow users of the same Supreme Daoist
            Physique. After all, he had the Sword Tribe’s strong support and
            guidance, with limitless amounts of resources at his disposal at any
            moment. So how could a sky-pride from the outside world possibly be
            a match for him despite possessing the same Exquisite Nine Orifices
            Sword Heart as he did?
          </p>
          <p>
            That was why he had not paid attention to Chu Kuangren all this
            while.
          </p>
          <p>However, he had no choice but to face Chu Kuangren now.</p>
          <p>
            “Hold up. Is this all your Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart can
            do? Or is it this clone body of yours that’s limiting you from
            exerting your full strength?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren looked at the Sword Daoist with a playful expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist was shocked. Chu Kuangren had revealed the fact
            that he was a clone in just those few words!
          </p>

            Chapter 539: Taking Down The Sword Daoist In A Single Sword
            Technique, To Set The Line For A Big Catch
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            “It seems that you’re not only highly skilled in sword Dao but also
            possess an extremely good eye. I didn’t think you could tell that
            this body of mine is only a clone.”
          </p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist replied.</p>
          <p>
            The clone refining technique he used was very advanced and cost him
            countless resources to create one. However, that resulted in a clone
            that looked no different from a normal person and could also
            practice cultivation like an ordinary cultivator. Even an Emperor
            Realm cultivator would not be able to see through this clone
            creation technique of his.
          </p>
          <p>
            He never expected his identity as a clone would be revealed by Chu
            Kuangren in an instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the onlooking sword cultivators at the scene were
            terribly stunned by both Chu Kuangren’s and the Sword Daoist’s
            dialogue.
          </p>
          <p>It was especially true for Qin Feng, who was in disbelief.</p>
          <p>A clone?!</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist before him was merely a clone!</p>
          <p>
            If that clone was already powerful enough to defeat him
            effortlessly, then how powerful would the real Sword Daoist be?!
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren looked at the Sword Daoist and said, “I might be a
            little more interested if the real you was here instead. Dealing
            with a clone is incredibly boring.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After speaking, Chu Kuangren stopped caring about him and proceeded
            to walk towards the Primitive Elite Swordgrass.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, this may be a clone, but do you think that I, the Sword
            Daoist will allow anyone to take me lightly? Don’t be too arrogant,
            Chu Kuangren!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist coldly snorted and raised his hand to unleash a
            sword technique. A turbulent surge of sword qi headed towards Chu
            Kuangren like a storm.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren did not even bat an eye at that attack. He
            merely gathered some sword qi in his fingers and casually struck
            out!
          </p>
          <p>A purple sword ray shot across the skies like a shooting star.</p>
          <p>
            In an instant, the overbearing sword qi storm was shattered by that
            single attack. The purple sword ray soon landed on the Sword
            Daoist’s body, sending him flying hundreds of meters away before he
            eventually crashed into the ground like a falling meteor. The impact
            smashed a gigantic crater in the ground, and in the center laid a
            disheveled Sword Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>
            On his body, there was a sword wound so deep and long that it almost
            cut his body in half. Huge amounts of blood gushed out from that
            critical wound.
          </p>
          <p>Everyone was stunned.</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist, who was unmatched in sword Dao, was just defeated
            by a single, effortless sword technique!
          </p>
          <p>That scene was just too dreadful.</p>
          <p>“How weak.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren casually remarked. After that, he walked toward the
            Primitive Elite Swordgrass, ignoring the surges of sword qi that it
            emanated. He simply reached out, grabbed the Supreme Elixir, and
            stored it inside his Yin and Yang ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            An Emperor-grade Supreme Elixir like the Primitive Elite Swordgrass
            would have a certain amount of benefit for him as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was not interested in the Primitive Elite Swordgrass, but a
            Supreme Elixir like this would increase his sword qi power.

            “Master Daoist, your body is currently a clone. You’re no match for
            someone like Chu Kuangren. Why don’t we retreat for now?”
          </p>
          <p>Jian Changfeng approached the Sword Daoist and suggested.</p>
          <p>“Very well!”</p>
          <p>
            After witnessing Chu Kuangren’s strength, the Sword Daoist nodded
            and left the area with Jian Changfeng’s help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren let out a playful grin as he looked at the Sword
            Daoist’s departing figure. “Oh, our little game has just begun, my
            dear Sword Daoist.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “So you’re Chu Kuangren, the one who killed my clan brother, Wang
            Tianteng.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At this time, Wang Xu looked at Chu Kuangren with an extremely
            unfriendly expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wang Tianteng? Hm... Let me think. I’ve killed quite a lot of
            sky-prides after all.” Chu Kuangren started to ponder.
          </p>
          <p>Everyone’s mouths twitched at his reaction.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Wang Tianteng is considered one of the well-known sky-prides in the
            Nine Heavens.’
          </p>
          <p>‘Yet Chu Kuangren needs to recall who he was?!’</p>
          <p>‘How many sky-prides have he killed up until now?!’</p>
          <p>
            “Oh, I got it. There is a person with that name.” Chu Kuangren
            nodded. “What’s the matter? Are you going to take revenge for his
            sake?”
          </p>
          <p>He looked at Wang Xu with an apathetic gaze and asked lightly.</p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing that, Wang Xu instantly felt a terrifying chill seeping
            through his heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            He clearly knew that if he responded with a “Yes”, he would be
            greeted by that terrifying surge of sword qi that even the Sword
            Daoist could not resist.
          </p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>Wang Xu shook his head and took two steps back.</p>
          <p>As such, Chu Kuangren ignored him.</p>
          <p>
            Not far away, both Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue soon caught up to
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of them were not that surprised to know that Chu Kuangren had
            obtained the Primitive Elite Swordgrass.
          </p>
          <p>Soon, the three of them left the area.</p>
          <p>
            Looking at their leaving figures, the Heavenly Divine Sword Sect’s
            Mo Yifan could not help but lament. “Having such terrifying power
            that even the Sword Daoist himself cannot hold his own against a
            single sword technique, this person’s combat strength is
            unfathomable. I can’t believe the outside world has an outlaw
            sky-pride like him!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. Just wait until my Wang clan’s outlaw sky-pride arrives.
            He’ll definitely defeat that person!” Wang Xu uttered coldly.
            n0𝑣𝓮𝐥𝗎𝗌𝗯.𝒸0𝐌
          </p>
          <p>The Wang clan had an outlaw sky-pride as well!</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, both the Sword Daoist and Jian Changfeng had arrived at a
            cave inside the Enchanted Forest Realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            After consuming an extremely valuable medicinal pill, the Sword
            Daoist went into closed-door meditation. It took more than half a
            day before the injuries on his body started to recover.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            There was a grim look on his face. “Who do you think you are, Chu
            Kuangren? How dare you injure my clone to such an extent? If not for
            this Golden Rejuvenation Pill that I have on me at all times, this
            clone would have been defeated in this Forest Realm. D*mn him, d*mn
            that insolent f*cker!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Before this, his intention to kill Chu Kuangren was because he did
            not want another Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart host to exist
            in this world.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, he wanted to kill Chu Kuangren now because of the hatred he
            had for him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having vented his rage, the Sword Daoist took a deep breath and
            said, “His strength is truly formidable and is almost on par with my
            real body. Killing this person won’t be an easy task. I should focus
            on getting the White Spiritual Divine Fruit for now. If I can manage
            to get the Divine Fruit, I’ll definitely have more confidence to get
            the Emperor’s Throne.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside him, Jian Changfeng’s eyes lit up, but he immediately
            retracted his gaze right after.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Changfeng, I bet it’s quite hard for you to protect me while I’m
            recovering. Here, take this spirit fruit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist took out a spirit fruit and gave it to Jian
            Changfeng.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thank you very much, Master Daoist.” Jian Changfeng excitedly
            received the spirit fruit.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that, a hint of contempt flashed across the Sword Daoist’s face.
          </p>
          <p>
            That spirit fruit was nothing much to him, yet it could be used to
            win the hearts of others around him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Master Daoist, I shall go and survey the surrounding area, just in
            case Chu Kuangren and the others decide to come and pursue us,” Jian
            Changfeng said.
          </p>
          <p>“Very well. Go ahead.”</p>
          <p>
            Once Jian Changfeng had left the cave, he activated several
            restrictive barriers around him to prevent others from spying on him
            with their spiritual thoughts. Then, he took out a communication
            compass and said, “Master...”
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>“Oh, the White Spiritual Divine Fruit?”</p>
          <p>
            After ending his call with Jian Changfeng, Chu Kuangren was
            surprised. “One of the rumored Ten Great Divine Fruits, huh? This is
            quite interesting indeed.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There were countless Supreme Elixirs and spirit fruits in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the Ten Great Spirit Fruits were ten of the most
            sought-after spirit fruits by all cultivators, as each of them
            possessed incredibly powerful effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Emperor-grade Supreme Elixirs like the Primitive Elite
            Swordgrass were extremely valuable, they still paled in comparison
            to the Ten Great Spirit Fruits.
          </p>
          <p>The White Spiritual Divine Fruits was one of those ten.</p>
          <p>
            It was said that this spirit fruit could increase the user’s
            cultivation level and cultivation capability, as well as enable them
            to enter a high-leveled Enlightenment Stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the records, an Honorable Realm cultivator once entered
            a state of Enlightenment after consuming the White Spiritual Divine
            Fruit. He was in it for three days and three nights before awakening
            to find that his understanding of Daoism was on par with that of an
            Emperor. Eventually, that cultivator found his own way of Dao and
            got the Emperor’s Throne within the next hundred years, ruling over
            everyone with his might throughout that whole epoch!
          </p>
          <p>
            It was clear that the White Spiritual Divine Fruit was an incredibly
            powerful item.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if there were countless Opportunities of Fortune within the
            Enchanted Forest Realm, spirit fruits like the White Spiritual
            Divine Fruit were extremely rare to come by.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The White Spiritual Divine Fruit, huh? This is something that I’ll
            definitely need to obtain. My dear Sword Daoist, you’ve brought me a
            splendid surprise indeed.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren smiled happily.</p>
          <p>
            Killing the Sword Daoist was nothing hard for him, but what benefit
            would he gain upon doing that?
          </p>
          <p>
            Killing an ant that served no threat to him would not bring him any
            satisfaction at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, the proper way to utilize someone like this would be to set
            the line for a big catch instead!

            Chapter 540: The Empyrean Frost Python, The Strange Female
            Cultivator, Chu Kuangren To The Rescue
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The opening of the Enchanted Forest Realm had attracted many
            sky-prides to enter and explore it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the outlaw sky-prides who barely showed themselves had entered
            it in search of Opportunities of Fortune. All of them were hoping to
            gain a greater advantage to become an Emperor when the Emperor
            Throne appeared.
          </p>
          <p>Somewhere inside the Enchanted Forest Realm.</p>
          <p>“Roar!!” n0𝒱𝔢𝑙𝑢𝓢𝕓.𝑪0𝑀</p>
          <p>
            With a terrifying roar, a huge frightening beast overflowing with
            ferocious qi was pursuing a female cultivator.
          </p>
          <p>
            That female cultivator was dressed in white and had long black hair
            over her shoulders. Her skin was shiny and had the appearance of
            frosted ice. Although she was chased by that wild beast[1], there
            was no sign of fear on her face. It was not because she was
            confident but as if she was born without any emotion instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I didn’t expect the Empyrean Frost Python to be that powerful. It
            looks like I was careless earlier.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator looked at the wild beast that was currently
            pursuing her and mumbled.
          </p>
          <p>
            That wild beast was a giant python that was three hundred meters
            long. It had a crystal white horn growing out from its head, while
            its body was covered in snowy white scales that were seething with
            terrifying freezing qi.
          </p>
          <p>Wherever it went, the ground froze in thick layers of snow.</p>
          <p>“Roar!”</p>
          <p>
            The Empyrean Frost Python roared, releasing great amounts of
            freezing qi from its mouth.
          </p>
          <p>“Heavenly Ice Shield!”</p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator uttered lightly as tremendous amounts of
            freezing qi emanated from her body as well, forming an ice shield in
            front of her.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when the two energies collided, the female cultivator’s ice
            shield instantly froze and shattered into pieces!
          </p>
          <p>
            Although both parties had freezing qi in their techniques, the
            Empyrean Frost Python’s freezing qi was even more powerful and
            terrifying than hers. It could freeze her ice shield even more!
          </p>
          <p>
            Large amounts of snowy icefalls swept out, forcing the female
            cultivator dozens of meters back. Soon, several hundred meters
            around her was enveloped within the freezing qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any plants or animals that were caught up in it were instantly
            frozen!
          </p>
          <p>
            Her sight was filled with a silver-white scene. It was as if
            everything in the world was frozen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator’s body was covered in a layer of ice as well.
            However, she channeled her spiritual power to shake the ice off her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your abilities are indeed impressive, human sky-pride. I didn’t
            think you would last so long in my hands.”
          </p>
          <p>The Empyrean Frost Python uttered.</p>
          <p>
            As a wild beast that was conceived within the Enchanted Forest Realm
            and gone through many years of cultivation, it had gained an
            intellect of its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Frost Python, I’m willing to offer you some items as compensation
            for my misbehavior. How about we put this matter behind?”
          </p>
          <p>The female cultivator looked at the Frost Python and said.</p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. You deserve nothing less than a painful death for trying to
            steal my horn! There’s no way I’m going to let this matter slide
            that easily!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems that I’ll have to fight with my life then,” the female
            cultivator uttered with a determined look on her face.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>“Now, die!”</p>
          <p>
            The Empyrean Frost Python spewed out vast amounts of freezing qi,
            which poured out from its mouth like an unstoppable frosty river.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strength of that freezing qi was on par with a top-notch
            Boundary Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon seeing that, the female cultivator released an incredibly
            mysterious surge of Daoist Rhyme from the palm of her hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Daoist Rhyme gathered and soon formed a white seal in the void
            that launched towards the incoming wave of freezing qi.
          </p>
          <p>“Mystical Wind Seal!”</p>
          <p>
            The gigantic seal crashed into the freezing qi. When the two
            energies collided, the Mystical Wind Seal gradually froze up.
          </p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator was also starting to show signs of fatigue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet with an indifferent expression, she raised her hand and
            channeled the spiritual power in her body once again. “Supreme
            Emotional Forgetting Pierce!”
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as she pointed her finger, a gigantic finger strength
            appeared within the void.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attack released a cold that could freeze one’s heart. This meant
            that it was not the coldness of nature but the coldness of a human
            heart!!
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, an explosion erupted!</p>
          <p>
            The finger strength brutally shattered the freezing qi before making
            its way to the Empyrean Frost Python’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a blast, great amounts of snowy white scales were destroyed. The
            Empyrean Frost Python’s head was almost dyed red from all the blood
            that was spurting out.
          </p>
          <p>“I did it!”</p>
          <p>
            Despite the female cultivator’s apathetic behavior, even she could
            not help but rejoice at what happened.
          </p>
          <p>“Roar!!”</p>
          <p>
            However, the Empyrean Frost Python roared into the skies, and a mix
            of an even more terrifying ferocious qi and freezing qi erupted.
          </p>
          <p>“You insolent human! How dare you injure me!!”</p>
          <p>
            The Empyrean Frost Python roared as its blood-stained eyes gazed
            coldly towards the female cultivator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its aura still remained incredibly menacing and powerful despite
            having been injured by the female cultivator’s most powerful attack.
          </p>
          <p>“Its physical body is even more terrifying!”</p>
          <p>The female cultivator uttered with surprise.</p>
          <p>
            After all, that piercing attack she unleashed earlier was strong
            enough to kill a Boundary Emperor. Yet, it only made the Empyrean
            Frost Python bleed a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its strong physical body was far beyond the female cultivator’s
            abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sovereign level. Only a Sovereign level of attack can kill this
            Empyrean Frost Python.”
          </p>
          <p>The female cultivator said frustratingly.</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, the enraged Empyrean Frost Python had already
            unleashed an attack towards her. With its mouth wide open, it dashed
            towards her, seeking to swallow her whole!
          </p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator wanted to escape but soon realized that the
            surrounding freezing qi had frozen her feet at some point, rendering
            her immobilized.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems like this will be the end of me today. What a shame.
            There’s still so much that I haven’t accomplished.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Facing her impending death, the female cultivator’s reaction was not
            huge. However, her heart began to race uncontrollably.
          </p>
          <p>An extremely unfamiliar emotion welled up in her.</p>
          <p>‘Is this the feeling of fear?’</p>
          <p>‘A sense of fear that every living being has by instinct?’</p>
          <p>
            Just when the female cultivator was about to meet her end in the
            python’s belly, a ray of sword ray suddenly struck out from afar.
          </p>
          <p>
            That sword ray shot through the skies like a crashing meteor before
            it slashed the Empyrean Frost Python’s horn.
          </p>
          <p>
            The horn was the strongest part of the Empyrean Frost Python’s body.
            Hence, the moment it was hit with the sword ray, a bright spark
            erupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sparks of light flew everywhere, followed by a crisp, clear
            sound of something being cracked open.
          </p>
          <p>The sword qi had created a huge crack on the horn!</p>
          <p>
            The Empyrean Frost Python could no longer be bothered by the female
            cultivator. With its horn damaged, it let out a frightening cry.
          </p>
          <p>“F*ck this. Who the hell is this! How dare you ambush me!!”</p>
          <p>
            The Empyrean Frost Python roared as it looked around its
            surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the air, a white-robed figure with black hair was approaching
            from afar.
          </p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator looked towards him and was momentarily dazed.
          </p>
          <p>
            She had seen all kinds of people throughout her life, and that
            naturally included countless so-called handsome men.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, none of them were able to tug the female cultivator’s
            heartstrings at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet now, the female cultivator noticed that her heart was seemingly
            throbbing. It was a little similar to her heartbeat racing when she
            was on the brink of death, but it was slightly different too.
          </p>
          <p>That female cultivator was a little confused.</p>
          <p>‘What kind of feeling is this?’</p>
          <p>
            ‘Is this what my fellow brothers and sisters were talking about
            within the sect? The so-called... tugging of heartstrings?!’
          </p>
          <p>
            Before she could think of anything more, the person who came, who
            was none other than Chu Kuangren, had started battling the Empyrean
            Frost Python.
          </p>
          <p>“How dare you ambush me, human! You’re dead to me!!”</p>
          <p>
            “I’ve taken an interest in that horn of yours, little snake. If
            you’d be so kind as to hand it to me yourself, I might let you
            live.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren uttered lightly, seemingly ignoring the female
            cultivator at the side. No matter how beautiful she was, she was
            still less attractive than the Empyrean Frost Python’s horn before
            the likes of him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Another one who wants my horn! Let’s see whether you’re able to get
            it then!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Empyrean Frost Python roared, its whole body shook, and its
            horn also began radiating with a bright white light. Tremendous
            amounts of freezing qi emanated from it, enveloping most of the
            skies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately after that, countless icicle spikes rained down on Chu
            Kuangren like a raging blizzard.
          </p>
          <p>“It seems like I’ll have to take it by force then.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren struck out with his Descendant Self Sword. A dense
            surge of sword qi poured out, swallowing the blizzard attack that
            had enveloped the skies.
          </p>
          <p>
            One by one, the countless icicles were shattered by the sword qi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just that strike alone was enough to shock the onlooking female
            cultivator.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Such tremendous combat strength! Which orthodoxy is this outlaw
            sky-pride from??”

          <p>“What a formidable sword qi.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s sword qi had put the female cultivator in disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although she had witnessed the power of several outlawed sky-prides
            before, few came close to Chu Kuangren’s combat strengths.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would only take one strike of sword qi from Chu Kuangren to
            defeat most Boundary Emperors.
          </p>
          <p>“Which orthodoxy does this outlawed sky-pride come from?”</p>
          <p>
            While the female cultivator was still overwhelmed by shock, Chu
            Kuangren’s battle with the Empyrean Frost Python had begun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Empyrean Frost Python possessed remarkable combat strengths. It
            could be considered the most fearsome beast that Chu Kuangren had
            ever encountered. Even the most remarkable Boundary Emperor would
            find it challenging to penetrate its strong flesh.
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately, it was not a difficult feat for Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren swung his Self-Descendant Sword, unleashing one surge
            of devastating sword qi after another that left its wounds on the
            Empyrean Frost Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            The injury was far from lethal, but it was enough for the Empyrean
            Frost Python to wail in pain.
          </p>
          <p>“Puny human, I shall kill you!”</p>
          <p>“I must kill you!”</p>
          <p>
            The ravaging Empyrean Frost Python slithered across the battlefield
            as it unleashed its fury of frost qi, causing the earth millions of
            kilometers around it to rumble.
          </p>
          <p>Countless rivers and forests were frozen over by its frost qi.</p>
          <p>
            Soon, everything within millions of kilometers had turned into a
            winter wasteland that was devoid of any lifeforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren gently strolled across the Empyrean Frost Python’s
            frost qi. His surrounding sword qi had rendered the Empyrean Frost
            Python’s attacks completely futile.
          </p>
          <p>“Before you try to kill me, take a look above you!”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said abruptly.</p>
          <p>
            Dozens of pale blue runic lines were chained together in the sky to
            form a gigantic rune that enshrouded the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the rune was endless lightning energy, which shot out a glare
            that released its terrifying Heavenly Might.
          </p>
          <p>It was the Emperor-grade Lightning Rune!</p>
          <p>“Such energy, is it the heavenly tribulation?”</p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">

                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            “But how’s that possible? Who in this world could possibly call upon
            the power of the heavenly tribulation?”
          </p>
          <p>The Empyrean Frost Python was confused.</p>
          <p>
            Then, a ferocious thunder dragon clawed out of the enormous rune and
            raced down to the Empyrean Frost Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a deafening roar, the mighty thunder dragon dashed through the
            sky towards the Empyrean Frost Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thunder dragon was several times larger than the Empyrean Frost
            Python. Its power was so intimidating that the Empyrean Frost
            Python’s scales vibrated violently as it unleashed all of its frost
            qi in its clash against the thunder dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terrifying lightning energy and frost qi collided into an abrupt
            explosion.
          </p>
          <p>The realm shook in its power. The rivers trembled...</p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator mustered all of her remaining spiritual power
            to shield herself from the incoming blast wave.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Empyrean Frost Python absorbed the damage from the thunder
            dragon, a boundless amount of lightning energy seeped into its body
            through the wounds left by Chu Kuangren, rupturing his internal body
            structure. The once pristine exterior of the Empyrean Frost Python
            gradually turned charred, as if it had been roasted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, the thunder dragon dissipated, and the enormous Empyrean Frost
            Python collapsed into the ground. Its frost qi had disappeared,
            leaving only clouds of steam that emerged from his body.
          </p>
          <p>“You b*stard...”</p>
          <p>
            Even as it struggled to catch its breath, the Empyrean Frost Python
            managed to stare at Chu Kuangren and curse at him.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren did not mind.</p>
          <p>
            He merely swung his sword and sliced the horn off the beast’s head.
          </p>
          <p>
            The horn was an invaluable part of the Empyrean Frost Python. Having
            already sustained heavy injuries, the beast’s energy ceased when the
            horn was removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren retrieved the horn that was radiating with frost qi and
            grinned. “Qingxue will definitely find this horn to be a valuable
            item.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Having trained in frost Dao, a frost treasure like the Empyrean
            Frost Python’s horn would resonate soundly with Shang Qingxue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My Daoist Brother, I am Leng Ningyu of the Seven Emotions Sect. Can
            I have the Empyrean Frost Python’s horn? I’m willing to exchange an
            item of equal value in return.”
          </p>
          <p>The female cultivator said to Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>Leng Ningyu of the Seven Emotions Sect?</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren stared strangely at her.</p>
          <p>The Seven Emotions Sect was not an unfamiliar name to him.</p>
          <p>
            As for Leng Ningyu, he could recall her name from the information
            that Swordsman Mei provided about the Sword Daoist the last time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Chu Kuangren remembered correctly, the Sword Daoist was quite
            obsessed with this person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren grinned mischievously and activated his Eye of
            Revelation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Leng Ningyu, the Sage of Seven Emotions Sect, an outlawed sky-pride
            of the Emperor Road. She cultivates the highest technique of the
            Seven Emotions Sect, Unruffled Emotions...”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Her current cultivation level is a Seven-Step Sage Ruler... Her
            combat strengths can rival even the most remarkable Boundary
            Emperors...”
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>Chu Kuangren analyzed Leng Ningyu’s information.</p>
          <p>A cultivator trained in the path of Unruffled Emotions?</p>
          <p>
            Such cultivators had long made the decision to abandon their desire
            for romance. They were some of the strongest cultivators as they
            possessed little to no weaknesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, if a cultivator could let go of all possibility of love,
            what weaknesses could they possibly have?
          </p>
          <p>
            At that thought, Chu Kuangren stared at Leng Ningyu, which was no
            different than staring at a piece of cold, hard rock.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Leng Ningyu were capable of feeling, perhaps it would be a
            different story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just the fact that she was the Sword Daoist’s romantic interest
            meant there must be some use to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Leng Ningyu had chosen to abandon all forms of love. She
            was no different than a piece of rock, leaving little room for her
            to be used.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m sorry, but this horn is pretty important to me. Goodbye.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite Leng Ningyu being a rather attractive lady, her stone-cold
            personality left little interest for Chu Kuangren to pursue this
            friendship further.
          </p>
          <p>He bid her goodbye on a whim and vanished into a sword ray.</p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu frowned slightly at Chu Kuangren’s departing figure.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some reasons unknown to her, Chu Kuangren’s reaction had made
            her rather... sad.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although she had seen such reactions in countless others, her
            emotions had always remained unperturbed.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, Leng Ningyu could feel a hint of discomfort.</p>
          <p>It felt as if Chu Kuangren was different from the rest.</p>
          <p>Why?</p>
          <p>They had merely met for the first time.</p>
          <p>Leng Ningyu felt a burning discomfort within her chest.</p>
          <p>Spit...</p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu spat a mouthful of fresh blood, and her entire face
            turned white.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This isn’t good. There seems like something’s wrong with my
            Unruffled Emotions.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu’s frown was much deeper now. She hastily calmed her
            emotions, which was not a difficult task for her. After all, she
            cultivated the path of Unruffled Emotions. Restoring her initial
            emotional state was a simple feat.
          </p>
          <p>Soon, Leng Ningyu managed to recover her demeanor.</p>
          <p>
            She stored the Empyrean Frost Python’s corpse into her Yin and Yang
            Ring. “I may not have managed to get the horn, but the Empyrean
            Frost Python is still an extreme frost beast that can be used to
            control Honorable Teacher’s flame poison.”
          </p>
          <p>She muttered and stared in Chu Kuangren’s direction.</p>
          <p>
            “He nearly made me lose control over my Unruffled Emotions. It looks
            like I’ll have to be careful around him in the future.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu could not fathom the reason behind her peculiar reaction
            towards Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            To her, this was a situation that was countless times more
            terrifying than fighting the Empyrean Frost Python.

          <p>“What a formidable sword qi.”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s sword qi had put the female cultivator in disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although she had witnessed the power of several outlawed sky-prides
            before, few came close to Chu Kuangren’s combat strengths.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would only take one strike of sword qi from Chu Kuangren to
            defeat most Boundary Emperors.
          </p>
          <p>“Which orthodoxy does this outlawed sky-pride come from?”</p>
          <p>
            While the female cultivator was still overwhelmed by shock, Chu
            Kuangren’s battle with the Empyrean Frost Python had begun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Empyrean Frost Python possessed remarkable combat strengths. It
            could be considered the most fearsome beast that Chu Kuangren had
            ever encountered. Even the most remarkable Boundary Emperor would
            find it challenging to penetrate its strong flesh.
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately, it was not a difficult feat for Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren swung his Self-Descendant Sword, unleashing one surge
            of devastating sword qi after another that left its wounds on the
            Empyrean Frost Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            The injury was far from lethal, but it was enough for the Empyrean
            Frost Python to wail in pain.
          </p>
          <p>“Puny human, I shall kill you!”</p>
          <p>“I must kill you!”</p>
          <p>
            The ravaging Empyrean Frost Python slithered across the battlefield
            as it unleashed its fury of frost qi, causing the earth millions of
            kilometers around it to rumble.
          </p>
          <p>Countless rivers and forests were frozen over by its frost qi.</p>
          <p>
            Soon, everything within millions of kilometers had turned into a
            winter wasteland that was devoid of any lifeforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren gently strolled across the Empyrean Frost Python’s
            frost qi. His surrounding sword qi had rendered the Empyrean Frost
            Python’s attacks completely futile.
          </p>
          <p>“Before you try to kill me, take a look above you!”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said abruptly.</p>
          <p>
            Dozens of pale blue runic lines were chained together in the sky to
            form a gigantic rune that enshrouded the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the rune was endless lightning energy, which shot out a glare
            that released its terrifying Heavenly Might.
          </p>
          <p>It was the Emperor-grade Lightning Rune!</p>
          <p>“Such energy, is it the heavenly tribulation?”</p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">

                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            “But how’s that possible? Who in this world could possibly call upon
            the power of the heavenly tribulation?”
          </p>
          <p>The Empyrean Frost Python was confused.</p>
          <p>
            Then, a ferocious thunder dragon clawed out of the enormous rune and
            raced down to the Empyrean Frost Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a deafening roar, the mighty thunder dragon dashed through the
            sky towards the Empyrean Frost Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thunder dragon was several times larger than the Empyrean Frost
            Python. Its power was so intimidating that the Empyrean Frost
            Python’s scales vibrated violently as it unleashed all of its frost
            qi in its clash against the thunder dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terrifying lightning energy and frost qi collided into an abrupt
            explosion.
          </p>
          <p>The realm shook in its power. The rivers trembled...</p>
          <p>
            The female cultivator mustered all of her remaining spiritual power
            to shield herself from the incoming blast wave.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Empyrean Frost Python absorbed the damage from the thunder
            dragon, a boundless amount of lightning energy seeped into its body
            through the wounds left by Chu Kuangren, rupturing his internal body
            structure. The once pristine exterior of the Empyrean Frost Python
            gradually turned charred, as if it had been roasted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, the thunder dragon dissipated, and the enormous Empyrean Frost
            Python collapsed into the ground. Its frost qi had disappeared,
            leaving only clouds of steam that emerged from his body.
          </p>
          <p>“You b*stard...”</p>
          <p>
            Even as it struggled to catch its breath, the Empyrean Frost Python
            managed to stare at Chu Kuangren and curse at him.
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren did not mind.</p>
          <p>
            He merely swung his sword and sliced the horn off the beast’s head.
          </p>
          <p>
            The horn was an invaluable part of the Empyrean Frost Python. Having
            already sustained heavy injuries, the beast’s energy ceased when the
            horn was removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren retrieved the horn that was radiating with frost qi and
            grinned. “Qingxue will definitely find this horn to be a valuable
            item.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Having trained in frost Dao, a frost treasure like the Empyrean
            Frost Python’s horn would resonate soundly with Shang Qingxue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My Daoist Brother, I am Leng Ningyu of the Seven Emotions Sect. Can
            I have the Empyrean Frost Python’s horn? I’m willing to exchange an
            item of equal value in return.”
          </p>
          <p>The female cultivator said to Chu Kuangren.</p>
          <p>Leng Ningyu of the Seven Emotions Sect?</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren stared strangely at her.</p>
          <p>The Seven Emotions Sect was not an unfamiliar name to him.</p>
          <p>
            As for Leng Ningyu, he could recall her name from the information
            that Swordsman Mei provided about the Sword Daoist the last time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Chu Kuangren remembered correctly, the Sword Daoist was quite
            obsessed with this person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren grinned mischievously and activated his Eye of
            Revelation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Leng Ningyu, the Sage of Seven Emotions Sect, an outlawed sky-pride
            of the Emperor Road. She cultivates the highest technique of the
            Seven Emotions Sect, Unruffled Emotions...”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Her current cultivation level is a Seven-Step Sage Ruler... Her
            combat strengths can rival even the most remarkable Boundary
            Emperors...”
          </p>

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>Chu Kuangren analyzed Leng Ningyu’s information.</p>
          <p>A cultivator trained in the path of Unruffled Emotions?</p>
          <p>
            Such cultivators had long made the decision to abandon their desire
            for romance. They were some of the strongest cultivators as they
            possessed little to no weaknesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, if a cultivator could let go of all possibility of love,
            what weaknesses could they possibly have?
          </p>
          <p>
            At that thought, Chu Kuangren stared at Leng Ningyu, which was no
            different than staring at a piece of cold, hard rock.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Leng Ningyu were capable of feeling, perhaps it would be a
            different story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just the fact that she was the Sword Daoist’s romantic interest
            meant there must be some use to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Leng Ningyu had chosen to abandon all forms of love. She
            was no different than a piece of rock, leaving little room for her
            to be used.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m sorry, but this horn is pretty important to me. Goodbye.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite Leng Ningyu being a rather attractive lady, her stone-cold
            personality left little interest for Chu Kuangren to pursue this
            friendship further.
          </p>
          <p>He bid her goodbye on a whim and vanished into a sword ray.</p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu frowned slightly at Chu Kuangren’s departing figure.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some reasons unknown to her, Chu Kuangren’s reaction had made
            her rather... sad.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although she had seen such reactions in countless others, her
            emotions had always remained unperturbed.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, Leng Ningyu could feel a hint of discomfort.</p>
          <p>It felt as if Chu Kuangren was different from the rest.</p>
          <p>Why?</p>
          <p>They had merely met for the first time.</p>
          <p>Leng Ningyu felt a burning discomfort within her chest.</p>
          <p>Spit...</p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu spat a mouthful of fresh blood, and her entire face
            turned white.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This isn’t good. There seems like something’s wrong with my
            Unruffled Emotions.”
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            To her, this was a situation that was countless times more
            terrifying than fighting the Empyrean Frost Python.

          <h4>
            Chapter 542: White Spiritual Divine Fruit, The Sword Daoist’s
            Despair
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            After slaying the Empyrean Frost Python, Chu Kuangren arrived at a
            mountain peak with his horn.
          </p>
          <p>He passed the horn over to Shang Qingxue.</p>
          <p>“Thank you so much, Sect Leader.”</p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue could feel the formidable Frost-based Daoist Rhymes
            that was radiating from the horn in her hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            If she could gain some insights from the item, her abilities would
            drastically improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue was touched. She could deduce just how powerful a
            beast was if it could produce such a horn. It was likely that none
            in Emperor Road would be capable of dealing with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren had gone to slay the Empyrean Frost Python
            just because the item was valuable to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Chu Kuangren’s foe had always seen him as a heartless
            person, he was nothing but kind to those around him.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the same reason why all of the Black Heaven Sect regarded Chu
            Kuangren as a great leader.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Looking at the time, we’ve been in the Enchanted Forest Realm for
            three days now,” said Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s right. We sure have found a lot of treasures in the past
            three days.”
          </p>
          <p>Murong Xuan said excitedly.</p>
          <p>
            With Chu Kuangren’s Treasure Locating Skill and undefeatable
            abilities, the group had discovered many treasures within the short
            three days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, all they needed now to leave this place and settle down at a
            location to consume their findings. Only then would they see a huge
            leap in their abilities.
          </p>
          <p>“I wonder what’s going on with the Sword Daoist now.”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren stroked his chin and muttered.</p>
          <p>
            Although Chu Kuangren had found many Opportunities of Fortune, he
            still could not forget the White Spiritual Divine Fruit that the
            Sword Daoist mentioned.
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of the Ten Great Spirit Fruits, the White Spiritual Divine
            Fruit would surely be of great use to Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>Just then, Chu Kuangren’s communication compass vibrated.</p>
          <p>It was a message from Jian Changfeng.</p>
          <p>“Oh, it looks like we’ve found something.”</p>
          <p>“Let’s see. Is this to the southeast direction?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren peered into the distance and grinned. Then, he gestured
            to Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue, “Come, let’s harvest ourselves
            some fruits.”
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>
            After getting injured by Chu Kuangren, the Sword Daoist spent an
            entire day recovering his wounds.

          <p>
            Following that, he found several valuable items of his own in the
            Enchanted Forest Realm and had begun searching for the White
            Spiritual Divine Fruit.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Dozens of millennia ago, the forefathers of the Sword Tribes
            visited the Enchanted Forest Realm and found the White Spiritual
            Divine Fruit. As the divine fruit had yet to ripen at that time,
            they laid a forbidden seal around the area and awaited the day it
            would finally ripen.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alas, the heavens are unpredictable. Before the Enchanted Forest
            Realm could reopen, my forefathers perished in their journeys and
            left nothing but this map in the aftermath.”
          </p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist said as he held a map in his hand.</p>
          <p>
            There was a glowing dot on the map that indicated the Sword Daoist’s
            current location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several thousands of kilometers away was another glowing dot, which
            indicated the location of the White Spiritual Divine Fruit.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Once I get the White Spiritual Divine Fruit, I shall ascend
            smoothly into the Emperor’s Throne!”
          </p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist exclaimed confidently.</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist was already endowed with remarkable talents that
            made him a likely candidate for the Emperor’s Throne. With the help
            of the White Spiritual Divine Fruit, he would far surpass any of the
            outlawed sky-prides!
          </p>
          <p>
            It was difficult for the Sword Daoist to contain his excitement at
            the thought of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It looks like I must congratulate you in advance, Master Daoist,”
            said Jian Changfeng.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hah! Changfeng, I’ll be sure to treat you well once I become an
            Emperor. You and Mei’er shall be my trustworthy right-hand men.”
          </p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist chuckled lightly.</p>
          <p>
            Jian Changfeng and Swordsman Mei were two of the most remarkable
            sky-prides in the Sword Tribe. One could say that they were the
            central pillars of the Sword Tribe’s future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting them on his good side was the quickest way for the Sword
            Daoist to gain control of the Sword Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your generosity is much appreciated, Master Daoist,” Jian Changfeng
            said passionately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, the Sword Daoist and Jian Changfeng arrived at a mountain
            range.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the mountain range looked unsuspecting, it was laced with
            many traps and seals that would torment even a Boundary Emperor once
            activated.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the Sword Daoist was confident. In his hand was his
            forefather’s map that laid the safest path to take in the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            As long as the Sword Daoist stuck to the route, he would not set off
            any traps and seals.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist led the way into the mountain range.</p>
          <p>Shortly after, Chu Kuangren and his disciples arrived too.</p>
          <p>
            Staring over the unsuspecting mountain range before him, Chu
            Kuangren mobilized his spiritual thoughts and could see the
            countless seals hidden beneath the surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seals were something Chu Kuangren could easily deal with by
            swinging his sword a couple of times. However, this would
            unnecessarily alert the Sword Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Sword Daoist were alerted, it would do Chu Kuangren no good.
          </p>
          <p>
            He still needed the Sword Daoist to lead him to the spirit fruit.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Such a shame. If the White Spiritual Divine Fruit was unsealed, my
            Treasure Locating Skill could’ve easily located it.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren shook his head and lamented.</p>

            “Sect Leader, look over there,” Murong Xuan said as he pointed to a
            spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were traces of broken soul emblem fragments scattered on the
            ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, Jian Changfeng must’ve left these. It looks like he can be
            relied upon after all.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren smiled with pleasure.</p>
          <p>
            With Jian Changfeng’s markings, the group could easily follow the
            footsteps taken by the Sword Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Deep within the mountain range lay a turquoise lake.</p>
          <p>
            The lake water permeated with a thick surge of spiritual powers. On
            a closer look, it was actually a pool of soul sap!
          </p>
          <p>
            Just these soul saps alone could fetch values equivalent to several
            tonnes of soul emblems.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the middle of the lake stood a mythical, lush green tree that was
            as tall as the average person.
          </p>
          <p>The tree only bore a single piece of white fruit.</p>
          <p>
            The fruit was about the size of a fist. It was pristine like white
            jade, surrounded by a gentle cloud of white mist as it radiated
            magnificent ripples of Daoist Rhymes. n0𝓥𝐄𝗅𝐔𝕊𝐁.𝑐0𝑚
          </p>
          <p>
            It was none other than the White Spiritual Divine Fruit, one of the
            Ten Great Spirit Fruits that was much sought after by countless
            cultivators!
          </p>
          <p>“I’ve finally found it.”</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist stepped out of the seal.</p>
          <p>
            He stared excitedly at the White Spiritual Divine Fruit before him
            and exclaimed, “It looks like the White Spiritual Divine Fruit has
            fully ripened!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist arrived before the tree in a flash. With his hand
            covered in a layer of spiritual power, he attempted to reach out for
            the White Spiritual Divine Fruit.
          </p>
          <p>Just then, the White Spiritual Divine Fruit shook slightly.</p>
          <p>
            The spirit fruit unplucked itself from the tree and flew into the
            distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sudden change caught the Sword Daoist off guard as he
            immediately gave chase to the White Spiritual Divine Fruit.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, a surge of sword qi greeted the Sword Daoist.</p>
          <p>
            The familiar aura forced the Sword Daoist to draw his long sword and
            swing it across the incoming attack!
          </p>
          <p>His sword qi burst with unstoppable momentum.</p>
          <p>
            As the Sword Daoist’s sword qi clanked with the incoming sword qi,
            his body was sent dozens of meters backward.
          </p>
          <p>“This sword qi, it’s you!”</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist stared into the distance.</p>
          <p>
            He could only watch as a formless mind power levitated the White
            Spiritual Divine Fruit to a mountain peak, where a young man grabbed
            it and spun it in his hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the handsome young man who was in white clothes was Chu
            Kuangren!
          </p>
          <p>
            “How’s it you again? Why are you here?!” The Sword Daoist stared
            deadly into Chu Kuangren as a sense of despair overwhelmed him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist had gone through all that effort of searching for
            the White Spiritual Divine Fruit. Yet before he could touch it, the
            divine fruit fell into the hands of another person.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist was infuriated beyond belief. How he wished he was
            granted the power to kill Chu Kuangren with his eyes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>Chapter 543: What A Pitiful Daoist, A Spiritual Qi Leyline</h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>“Chu Kuangren, why are you here?!”</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist stared furiously at the White Spiritual Divine
            Fruit, which was now in Chu Kuangren’s hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I noticed that this place is sealed, so I came to check it out.
            Lucky me, I never thought I’d bumped into this White Spiritual
            Divine Fruit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said nonchalantly and stored the spirit fruit into his
            Yin and Yang Ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist could not take it any longer. He drew his long
            sword and struck it at Chu Kuangren in a flash.
          </p>
          <p>
            His merciless sword Daoist Rhymes unleashed, and the spiritual
            powers around him converged into a wind blade that swarmed towards
            Chu Kuangren. n0𝒱𝐄𝔩𝑈𝓈𝚋.𝒸0𝓂
          </p>
          <p>“Wind of the Sword!”</p>
          <p>It was a powerful Emperor Technique.</p>
          <p>
            Moreover, it was an Emperor Technique that resonated deeply with the
            Sword Daoist’s Dao. As such, the power that the Sword Daoist drew
            surpassed that of most Boundary Emperors.
          </p>
          <p>In response, Chu Kuangren unleashed a ray of sword qi.</p>
          <p>
            The devastating purple sword ray gushed out like a violent torrent.
            At one go, the Sword Daoist’s sword qi shattered, and he was blasted
            several hundred meters away.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve got a little something on my schedule, so I’ll spare your life
            again this time.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said faintly before he vanished into a sword ray.</p>
          <p>“D*mn it! D*mn it!”</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist’s whole body was trembling in anger.</p>
          <p>
            The White Spiritual Divine Fruit was a priceless treasure to the
            Sword Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a treasure that required meticulous planning ever since his
            forefather’s times. The Sword Daoist had spent so long pursuing it
            only to have it taken by Chu Kuangren just like that.
          </p>
          <p>How could he bear such humiliation?</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist screeched in anger. Suddenly, he spat out a
            mouthful of blood, and his face turned pale.
          </p>
          <p>It seemed like Chu Kuangren had injured him again.</p>
          <p>
            “D*mn it. I’ve used up the Rewind Marrow Pill I brought along. If
            this goes on, it looks like I won’t be able to use this clone
            anymore.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist looked at the spiritual tree that bore the White
            Spiritual Divine Fruit.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the spirit fruit was harvested, the tree had wilted. However,
            the lake of spirit sap that surrounded it was still there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist’s eyes lit up. He immediately walked towards the
            pool and soaked himself within before mobilizing his spiritual power
            and absorbing all of the spirit sap into his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the spirit sap’s nurture, not only did the Sword Daoist’s
            wound disappear, but he felt his cultivation level increasing as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What a surprising discovery! I didn’t think the spirit sap would
            have such a property.”
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>However, his face soon sunk again.</p>
          <p>
            The spirit saps were just the byproducts of the spirit tree. If just
            the byproducts alone could yield such healing property, just how
            miraculous would the White Spiritual Divine Fruit be?
          </p>
          <p>
            At this thought, the Sword Daoist’s heart ached. His hatred towards
            Chu Kuangren was now amplified.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, I swear on my life that I shall have my revenge!”
          </p>
          <p>He grunted and swore.</p>
          <p>
            “There must be other opportunities in the Enchanted Forest Realm. If
            I use them wisely, perhaps I could even defeat Chu Kuangren with
            just a clone!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “There are still ten days before this realm disappears. I must
            collect as many valuable items as I can.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist took a deep breath and planned for his comeback.
          </p>
          <p>He then left the mountain range along with Jian Changfeng.</p>
          <p>
            In the distance, Chu Kuangren had learned all about the Sword
            Daoist’s next plan with the help of Jian Changfeng.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, Sword Daoist, what more surprises do you have for me?”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren smirked.</p>
          <p>“Sect Leader, why didn’t you take the soul sap as well?”</p>
          <p>
            Shang Qingxue asked curiously. She knew Chu Kuangren was not the
            kind of person who would share his spoils with his enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The soul saps are of no use to me. So why not let him bask in his
            joy a little more? Otherwise, he wouldn’t have the confidence to
            fight me.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said with a smile.</p>
          <p>
            Murong Xuan and Shang Qingxue could not help but sympathize with the
            Sword Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>It was hard not to.</p>
          <p>
            Never mind that he was surrounded by undercovers. Even the Sword
            Daoist’s confidence was a plot written by Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>What a pitiful Daoist the Sword Daoist was.</p>
          <p>Two days later.</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist was absorbing an Emperor-grade Supreme Elixir into
            his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, a wave of majestic aura erupted from his body, spanning
            several thousands of kilometers across.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Who would’ve thought I’d found an Emperor-grade Supreme Elixir in
            this place? After this, this clone’s combat strengths would be as
            close as it can get to my actual power.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even if it can’t defeat Chu Kuangren, it can surely put on a good
            fight.”
          </p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist inhaled deeply and said.</p>
          <p>“Congratulations, Master Daoist.”</p>
          <p>At the side, Jian Changfeng congratulated him.</p>
          <p>
            “We still have a few days left. Who knows what other surprises await
            us in this Enchanted Forest Realm?”
          </p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist was feeling hopeful.</p>

          <p>
            The Enchanted Forest Realm was indeed a huge Opportunity of Fortune
            in the Emperor Road. The treasures here far surpassed that of any
            orthodoxies in the Emperor Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            In just a few days, the Sword Daoist had benefited from so many
            Opportunities of Fortune, which would have taken him one hundred
            years of training just to achieve the same effect.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>Just then, the ground began to shake.</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist and Jian Changfeng glanced at their surroundings
            puzzledly.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
          <p>
            “This is an intense tremor. Is this happening across all of the
            Enchanted Forest Realm?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist and Jian Changfeng exchanged looks before they
            levitated into the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the entire Enchanted Forest Realm was trembling, which
            dumbfounded many cultivators within it.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on? Why’s the realm shaking?”</p>
          <p>“What in the heavens is happening?”</p>
          <p>“Look, over there...”</p>
          <p>One of the cultivators exclaimed.</p>
          <p>In the distance, a green pillar shot up into the sky.</p>
          <p>The closer to the pillar, the stronger the tremor.</p>
          <p>
            The pillar expanded, forming large fissures in the ground where
            copious amounts of green mist seeped out of the crevices and clouded
            the surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon soaking in the green mist, some of the cultivators could feel
            their entire body loosen up as if all of their soreness and
            exhaustion had gone away.
          </p>
          <p>
            The green gas was also imbued with rich spiritual qi that the
            cultivators could easily convert into spiritual powers.
          </p>
          <p>“This must be a huge Opportunity of Fortune!”</p>
          <p>
            “Oh heavens, just what items could possibly lay within the fissure
            to be able to emit such a distinctive aura?”
          </p>
          <p>The cultivators stared into fissures, finding it unbelievable.</p>
          <p>Up on top of a mountain peak in the distance.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren grabbed a cloud of green gas and converted it into
            spiritual power with his Universal Cauldron Physique.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hm, interesting. I wonder what lies beneath the massive fissure.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said curiously.</p>
          <p>
            The cultivators in the Enchanted Forest Realm watched as the fissure
            became larger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, the green light faded and the content beneath the ground
            became available for all to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a fissure that spanned several kilometers deep and up to ten
            thousand kilometers wide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within it laid an array of Supreme Elixirs, divine fruits, and green
            crystals. Each of them was emitting palpable energy waves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “T-this is a Spiritual Qi Leyline! A wood-based Spiritual Qi
            Leyline!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “So many elixirs and divine fruits! I wonder just how dense the wood
            spiritual qi is and the number of years it must have taken to
            produce such items.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The ground must have collapsed because it can no longer hold the
            spiritual qi together! Oh heavens, this is unbelievable.”
          </p>

          <h4>
            Chapter 544: The Outlawed Sky-prides Appear, Splitting The Spiritual
            Qi Leyline
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The sudden emergence of the Spiritual Qi Leyline had shocked many in
            the Enchanted Forest Realm.
          </p>
          <p>The cultivators soon descended into a manic state.</p>
          <p>There were a lot of them.</p>
          <p>
            There were so many treasures within the grounds that they could not
            retain their composers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh heavens, such an abundance of treasures! I’d be rich if I could
            just get my hands on a couple of them!”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s right! Let’s get it!”</p>
          <p>
            “That’s the Primordial Blood Spirit Fruit, an Emperor-grade Supreme
            Elixir! That one’s mine.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The cultivators immediately swarmed into the Spiritual Qi Leyline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just then, a red silhouette appeared above the Spiritual Qi Leyline
            and unleashed a blast of devastating aura. It was none other than
            the outlawed sky-pride of the Bai clan, Bai Hongyu!
          </p>
          <p>
            With her cold, gleaming eyes, Bai Hongyu muttered, “Everything
            within eight hundred kilometers belongs to me. Those who dare
            trespass shall face death!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu released a palm technique as she uttered her threats.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the unfortunate cultivators who got caught in her aura’s
            radius was instantly reduced into blood mist.
          </p>
          <p>The abrupt escalation of events shocked many.</p>
          <p>“This Bai Hongyu is one cocky person.”</p>
          <p>
            “Nothing new here. She’s an outlawed sky-pride, so she naturally has
            the guts to talk that way.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The few of us aren’t strong enough to defeat an outlawed sky-pride.
            Let’s just head to another location.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s right.”</p>
          <p>No one dared to provoke Bai Hongyu after the dramatic event.</p>
          <p>
            After all, the leyline spanned over a massive region. There were
            still many unoccupied territories that were outside of Bai Hongyu’s
            grasp.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, now that Bai Hongyu had made the first move, how could the
            rest of the outlawed sky-prides just stand by and watch?
          </p>
          <p>A sword ray suddenly shot up into the sky.</p>
          <p>
            The sword rays dispersed over the region, and its intimidating
            Sword-based Daoist Rhyme spread eight hundred kilometers across.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Every land within eight hundred kilometers is my territory.
            Trespass and you shall die!”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the Sword Daoist’s voice. He stood determinedly in the air as
            his sword qi overwhelmed his surroundings. No one dared challenge
            his presence.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn it. Now the Sword Daoist’s here too.”</p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">

              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>“There’s more.”</p>
          <p>
            After the Sword Daoist made his move, a multicolored array of energy
            erupted in the distance, forming a light barrier that encompassed a
            thousand kilometers in diameter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The light barrier spun with the Five Ways energy of Gold, Wood,
            Water, Fire, and Soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            A stellar young man in white robes appeared. His spiritual powers
            formed a large domineering ripple that painted him as an incarnate
            of a living deity!
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Wang clan is taking everything within a thousand kilometers
            from here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The white-robed youngster spoke indifferently. His determined gaze
            and overpowering aura were as strong as those of the Sword Daoist
            and Bai Hongyu.
          </p>
          <p>Wang Quan!</p>
          <p>The outlawed sky-pride of the Wang clan!</p>
          <p>
            “Haha. Now that all of you have shown yourselves, it’s time I join
            the party too.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Dark clouds gathered in the sky, followed by the descent of a
            terrifying demonic qi that engulfed everything in a thousand
            kilometers!
          </p>
          <p>The terrifying demonic aura made it hard for anyone to breathe.</p>
          <p>
            A masculine youngster in jet-black armor gradually descended from
            the dark clouds.
          </p>
          <p>As his feet touched the ground, the earth crumbled!</p>
          <p>
            “This thousand-kilometers belong to my demonic tribe! Enter and you
            will die!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The assertive youngster glanced at his surroundings. There was a
            thick presence of demonic qi behind him, creating the illusion that
            a million demonic beasts were howling in unison.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was the outlawed sky-pride of the Underworld Demonic Realm,
            Touheng!
          </p>
          <p>
            Touheng was accompanied by a sky-pride who also came from the
            Demonic Realm. It was Touba, a sky-pride who had once made it onto
            the Soaring Dragon Leaderboard.
          </p>
          <p>“Roar!”</p>
          <p>
            A furious screech echoed, its terrorizing soundwave rumbling
            everything within a thousand-kilometers radius.
          </p>
          <p>
            An enormous nine-headed serpent emerged from the woods. Everything
            around the creature was either combusted into ashes or swept away by
            a violent flood.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sky-prides immediately gasped at the sight of that creature.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s him, Jiu Yan of the Nine-Headed Snakelet Tribe!”</p>
          <p>
            “Even the outlawed sky-pride of the archaic bestial clan’s here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Jiu Yan’s abilities are considered one of the most terrifying even
            amongst the outlawed sky-prides. It seems like even he could not
            resist the Spiritual Qi Leyline’s attraction.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Never mind the ordinary sky-prides. Even the outlawed sky-prides
            were wary of Jiu Yan.
          </p>
          <p>The archaic bestial clans were a formidable force.</p>
          <p>
            Due to their strengths, there had never been many such beasts
            around. However, each of them was a respectable entity of its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            What more, Jiu Yan was the most stellar sky-pride of the Nine-Headed
            Snakelet Tribe.

          <p>
            “I’m taking everything within one thousand and five hundred
            kilometers. Lay your hands upon those treasures, and I shall swallow
            you into my belly!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan’s centermost head spoke while the rest glared across their
            surroundings. Those who were unfortunate to cross eyes with him
            could feel a chilling numbness down their spine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cultivators were wary enough of the other outlawed sky-prides.
            There was no way they would mess with an archaic beast like Jiu Yan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu, the Sword Daoist, Wang Quan, Touheng, and Jiu Yan had
            taken half of the Spiritual Qi Leyline. Some of the other remarkable
            sky-prides, despite not being as strong as their outlawed
            counterparts, had also mimicked their behaviors and went on to
            occupy smaller pieces of their territories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some spanned less than ten kilometers across, while others a couple
            of dozens. Most of the Spiritual Qi Leyline had been divided into
            smaller segments, which left little to no room for the ordinary
            sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no one was willing to leave after witnessing the abundance
            of treasures.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. What gives these sky-prides the right to hoard everything to
            themselves? Let’s gang up on them. I’m sure we can overpower these
            people.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s right! The outlawed sky-prides may be too strong for us, but
            not those people.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hear hear! We shall not let them have their ways!”</p>
          <p>
            Dissatisfied with the situation, most of the left-out sky-prides
            began to assemble against those who attempted to hoard the
            treasures.
          </p>
          <p>Soon, battles broke out across the leyline.</p>
          <p>
            Fortunately for the outlawed sky-prides, no one dared to challenge
            their authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            The outlawed sky-prides were viewed as vastly superior beings
            compared to the others. While the ordinary sky-prides may be able to
            defeat the excellent ones by outnumbering them, they knew better
            than to provoke the outlawed sky-prides, whose powers may rival that
            of a Boundary Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>“It looks like there’s quite a party going on there.”</p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan sneered at a group of sky-prides who were battling over a
            Supreme Elixir.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were easily hundreds of those within the territory that Jiu
            Yan laid claim over.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s start storing these Supreme Elixirs.”</p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu said to Xiao Jingchen. He was busy looking out to his
            surroundings, as if he was on the look for something.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you looking for?”</p>
          <p>
            “I’m looking for one particular person. I wonder if that b*stard
            will make an appearance.” n0𝓋𝑒𝑙𝗎𝓈𝑩.𝒸0𝚖
          </p>
          <p>Xiao Jingchen replied.</p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu frowned. She knew immediately who Xiao Jingchen was
            talking about.
          </p>
          <p>Not far away, Touba was scanning the perimeter as well.</p>
          <p>
            “This is such a huge Opportunity of Fortune. Don’t Chu Kuangren want
            it?” Touba frowned and muttered.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is Chu Kuangren the Supreme Sage you mentioned? Touba, you seem to
            worry about that person a lot.”
          </p>
          <p>Touheng came over and said nonchalantly.</p>
          <p>
            “Brother, never underestimate this person. The Demonic Realm’s plan
            to invade Firmament Star was curbed because of this one person. If I
            weren’t fortunate enough to escape in time, I would’ve been part of
            the corpse pile lying in the Purgatory Forest,” said Touba gravely.
            He harbored a deep sense of fear towards Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright. Let’s discuss it after we store these Supreme Elixirs.”
          </p>
          <p>“Okay.”</p>
          <p>
            Touba nodded and began to collect the Supreme Elixirs and spirit
            fruits in their territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, a violent storm ensued, bringing with it an overwhelming aura

          <h4>
            Chapter 545: Occupying The Entire Leyline Alone, Come At Me Together
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            A storm below over, sweeping a powerful Sword-based Daoist Rhyme
            across the Spiritual Qi Leyline.
          </p>
          <p>
            The outlawed sky-prides were appalled as they stared into the
            distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The realm was now clouded with the dense presence of sword qi, which
            manifested as twelve terrifying sword qi pillars, sealing the
            Spiritual Qi Leyline in its entirety!
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the Nine Heaven Sword Prison, the Daoist Transformation of the
            Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart!”
          </p>
          <p>“Is it the Sword Daoist?”</p>
          <p>“No. There’s one more person besides the Sword Daoist.”</p>
          <p>“He’s here!”</p>
          <p>
            The cultivators switched their attention in the same direction — the
            source of the boundless sword qi aura!
          </p>
          <p>
            A white-clothed young man glided across the air as sword qi
            blossomed in his path like a garden of lotuses.
          </p>
          <p>His excellent and remarkable poise shocked many cultivators.</p>
          <p>
            However, for Xiao Jingchen, Touba, and those unfortunate enough to
            have witnessed the youngster’s tactics, there was only terror
            written over their faces.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m taking this Spiritual Qi Leyline!” n0𝒱𝐄𝓁𝓊𝗌𝑩.𝗰0𝓂</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said calmly. Although he was not loud, his voice was
            heard clearly by every cultivator in the area.
          </p>
          <p>They were dumbfounded, to say the least.</p>
          <p>
            “If I’m hearing him right, he’s saying that he’s taking this entire
            stretch of Spiritual Qi Leyline!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, if my comprehension doesn’t fail me, I’m guessing the same
            too.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Did he just say he’s taking the entire leyline? How preposterous!
            Even the outlawed sky-prides are taking a part of it, but he’s
            laying claim over the entire thing?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The cultivators stared at Chu Kuangren as if he was some sort of a
            lunatic.
          </p>
          <p>How many treasures did this Spiritual Qi Leyline contain?</p>
          <p>
            It was a mind-numbing amount, so much so that no outlawed sky-prides
            had the courage nor capability to take all of it for themselves.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, Chu Kuangren did!</p>
          <p>
            “Classic Chu Kuangren. He’s always out there to make shocking
            announcements.”
          </p>
          <p>Xiao Jingchen inhaled deeply and said.</p>
          <p>He was not as shocked as the others.</p>
          <p>
            After all, Chu Kuangren’s doings before their arrival at the Emperor
            Road were no less dramatic than this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Holy cow! This guy is still as domineering as ever. That’s kind of
            sexy actually.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Zhang Hongying stared at Chu Kuangren as she smacked her lips. Her
            eyes were glimmering with admiration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ashura Tribe had always held warriors with high regard, and Chu
            Kuangren was undoubtedly the strongest of warriors!
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides, Chu Kuangren had helped the Ashura Tribe survive a disaster
            by sealing the Demonic Realm in Purgatory Forest. Hence, it was no
            surprise that Zhang Hongying was fond of him.

          <p>“You want the entire Spiritual Qi Leyline?”</p>
          <p>
            Wang Quan, Wang clan’s outlawed sky-pride sneered coldly. “Who are
            you kidding?! And just who do you think you are?”
          </p>
          <p>“Chu Kuangren, the person who dominates the Emperor Road!”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren said casually.</p>
          <p>
            He did not hesitate at all to declare himself as the person who
            dominated the Emperor Road.
          </p>
          <p>The sky-prides could not help but frown at his remark.</p>
          <p>Well, sh*t!</p>
          <p>
            How absurd was this guy? To treat every cultivator of this realm as
            if they were nothing!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, it takes more than just words to dominate the Emperor Road.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wang Quan snorted and said to the Sword Daoist, “Sword Daoist,
            you’re the host of the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart just like
            him. Don’t you have anything to say?”
          </p>
          <p>Everyone’s focus was now on the Sword Daoist.</p>
          <p>
            If the hosts of the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart fought, it
            would surely make a spectacular sword Dao battle!
          </p>
          <p>It would be an unprecedented battle in history.</p>
          <p>The cultivators were getting excited now.</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist’s face merely sunk after he heard Wang Quan.</p>
          <p>He could only stare at Chu Kuangren uneasily.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren stared back at the Sword Daoist mischievously and
            taunted, “Sword Daoist, do you dare?”
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t get too cocky now, Chu Kuangren.”</p>
          <p>The Sword Daoist uttered coldly.</p>
          <p>“Skip the nonsense. Do you dare or not?!”</p>
          <p>
            Any other outlawed sky-prides would have attacked in face of such
            pressing humiliation.
          </p>
          <p>However, the Sword Daoist did not make a move.</p>
          <p>
            Having been defeated twice in one move by Chu Kuangren, he was clear
            just how devastating Chu Kuangren’s abilities could be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even with all the Opportunities of Fortune he had collected over the
            past few days and his clone inching closer toward his true
            abilities, the Sword Daoist did not dare tread lightly.
          </p>
          <p>The cultivators could read the situation as well.</p>
          <p>Was the Sword Daoist scared?!</p>
          <p>He was scared of Chu Kuangren!</p>
          <p>The discovery caused the sky-prides to gasp.</p>
          <p>Who was the Sword Daoist?</p>
          <p>
            He was the Daoist of the Sword Tribe, an outlawed sky-pride who was
            most remarkable in sword Dao. Yet, a person like him was now
            hesitating to attack Chu Kuangren!
          </p>
          <p>
            The witnessing crowd thought the scene before them was too
            ridiculous.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh heavens. Are you afraid, Sword Daoist?”</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Wang Quan asked puzzledly as he could tell the Sword Daoist was
            afraid.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist grimaced and responded, “Wang Quan, you’re surely
            annoying as hell. Why don’t you attack him then?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist then retreated to a side and said. He was insistent
            on staying out in this fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a clear indication to all the cultivators that the Sword
            Daoist was indeed fearful of Chu Kuangren!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Where the hell did this fella come from? Even the Sword Daoist is
            afraid of him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Many in the Emperor Road did not know of Chu Kuangren before this.
            However, Chu Kuangren’s name had now been etched deeply within their
            memories.
          </p>
          <p>After all, he was a being that even the Sword Daoist feared!</p>
          <p>
            “It looks like you don’t have the guts after all,” said Chu
            Kuangren. He then looked at Wang Quan and the rest. “What about the
            rest?”
          </p>
          <p>“Hmph. I shall see what you’re truly made of!”</p>
          <p>
            Wang Quan grunted. His body began to glow in five arrays of colors
            as he unleashed ripples of tenacious energy.
          </p>
          <p>“Five Ways Technique, Broken Gold!”</p>
          <p>
            Wang Quan unleashed his fist technique, summoning a golden ray of
            light that was compounded with a strong gold qi that gushed out like
            a molten gold torrent!
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren did not draw his Self-Descendant Sword but instead
            retaliated with a fist technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            A terrifying dark fist qi burned with rage fire as it crashed into
            the molten gold torrent!
          </p>
          <p>
            The opposing energies exploded with a bang before the molten gold
            torrent began to swarm back at Wang Quan.
          </p>
          <p>“What?!”</p>
          <p>
            Amongst his five-colored lights, the one in yellow began to glow
            brighter as it formed an enormous shield before him. The shield had
            a thick gravitational pull.
          </p>
          <p>“Mountain River Shield!”</p>
          <p>
            The molten gold torrent and Chu Kuangren’s fist qi crashed into Wang
            Quan’s Mountain River Shield.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shield crumbled instantly as Wang Quan was blasted almost a
            hundred meters away.
          </p>
          <p>
            He stared gravely at Chu Kuangren. From that one technique, Wang
            Quan could deduce that Chu Kuangren’s abilities were much stronger
            than his!
          </p>
          <p>“Rage? What ties do you have with the Seven Emotions Sect?”</p>
          <p>Wang Quan questioned coldly.</p>
          <p>
            From the sideline, the Sword Daoist was beginning to feel uneasy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist’s romantic interest, Leng Ningyu, whom he cared so
            much for, was a Sage of the Seven Emotions Sect.
          </p>
          <p>“None,” said Chu Kuangren calmly.</p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, never mind that. Regardless of your ties to the Seven
            Emotions Sect, there’s no way you’re taking all of the Spiritual Qi
            Leyline for yourself!”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a lift of his hand, Wang Quan’s five-colored lights beamed all
            at once. It then summoned an enormous claw that reached towards Chu
            Kuangren. “Five Ways Grip of Capture!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The vibrant Five Ways energies coursed within the claw as they
            mercilessly attacked Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that all?”</p>
          <p>
            There was a hint of disappointment in Chu Kuangren’s eyes before he
            swung his Self-Descendant Sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            A strike of purple sword ray shot out into the air along with it a
            calamitous Daoist Rhyme that ruptured the enormous claw in half.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a loud wail, Wang Quan collapsed backward, and blood began to
            pour out of his right palm. His wound was deep enough to expose the
            bones within.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren gripped on the Self-Descendant Sword and looked across
            the outlawed sky-prides at the scene. “It’s too troublesome having
            to fight all of you one at a time. Just come at me together.”
          </p>

            Chapter 546: Overpowering A Wild Beast With Raw Strength, Which Dao

          <p></p>
          <p>
            “All of you should attack together,” Chu Kuangren gazed upon the
            group of people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing his words, Jiu Yan, Wang Quan, and the rest of the
            group were furious. Meanwhile, the remaining sky-prides were all
            scared speechless.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor Road has never had someone who desired to take on all
            the outlawed sky-prides solo.
          </p>
          <p>The crowd shuddered to think of what sight that would be.</p>
          <p>
            “Very bold of you, Chu Kuangren. Your skills may outclass everyone
            here, but don’t you think challenging all the outlawed sky-prides
            alone is way too cocky?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan growled fiercely. His enormous body then swiftly reduced in
            size, turning into a handsome golden-robed young man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even in his human form, Jiu Yan’s body was still emitting a violent,
            ferocious qi that was unique to wild beasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Nine-Headed Snakelet Tribe... I didn’t expect to see one of you
            here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said as he threw Jiu Yan a side-glance. n0𝒱𝞮𝗅𝔲𝐬𝑩.𝑪0𝕞
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, so you’ve encountered other Nine-Headed Snakelets before me?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes. I’ve killed one previously.”</p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing this, Jiu Yan’s expression immediately turned sullen.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, as archaic ancient beasts, the Nine-Headed Snakelet’s
            population was not abundant, to begin with. Whenever one was killed,
            their number would only dwindle further.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s bold act of killing a Nine-Headed Snakelet was
            undoubtedly equivalent to waging war against the entire Nine-Headed
            Snakelet Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If such, you shall be punished for your crimes!” Without explaining
            further, Jiu Yan immediately threw out the first strike.
          </p>
          <p>
            He unleashed a fist technique, where two distinct colors of red and
            blue light circulated around his fist. A surge of terrifying Water-
            and Fire-based Daoist Rhyme broke out from his fist and headed
            toward Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nine-Headed Snakelets were masters at bending Water and Fire energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it came to Water and Fire Dao, not many tribes could compare
            themselves with the Nine-Headed Snakelet Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Facing the Water- and Fire-based Daoist Rhyme that was fast
            approaching him, Chu Kuangren’s expression did not change one bit.
            Instead, he raised his arm and drew out his sword. Purple sword rays
            glided across the air like meteors, slashing away at the Water and
            Fire energy before continuing its way toward Jiu Yan in a straight
            line.
          </p>
          <p>“Truly remarkable!”</p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan let out a low growl, then held his fingers tight into a
            fist. The punch that he threw out next was made of the cleanest and
            purest raw strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan surprisingly shattered the purple sword ray. Although he was
            pushed back several dozen meters, he did not sustain any damage at
            all.

            Chu Kuangren commented plainly, and a look of curiosity flashed in
            his eyes. “I just wonder whether it’s stronger or weaker than my
            Supreme Sage body.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At that thought, he put the Descendant Self Sword away before
            looking up and stepping forward.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>His movements sent the entire space into a loud boom.</p>
          <p>
            The sound produced was from neither spiritual power nor Daoist
            Rhyme, but from his purest raw strength, which had clashed with the
            air particles.
          </p>
          <p>“What?!”</p>
          <p>The Nine-Headed Snakelet’s pupils narrowed.</p>
          <p>How could a human cultivator have such a horrific flesh body?!</p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan was not even given much time to think before Chu Kuangren
            was already in front of him. With a punch, a buzz echoed in the void
            in his surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>Jiu Yan crossed his arms in front of him to block it.</p>
          <p>
            An incredibly majestic force erupted, and Jiu Yan felt as if the
            bones in his two arms were about to be shattered.
          </p>
          <p>“What the hell!”</p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan let out a painful squeal. His two arms trembled incessantly
            at the shock that Chu Kuangren’s punch was able to blast him back
            several hundred meters.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that all your flesh body is capable of?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren dashed toward him again, covering over a hundred meters
            distance within a second. In a split second, he threw a thunderous
            kick at him. The space between them howled, and a gust of wind swept
            out.
          </p>
          <p>This kick was too quick and too hard!</p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan could not dodge it in time, and the kick landed on his head
            brutally. He was sent flying backward like a loose cannon before his
            body smashed onto a canyon not far away. With a bang, the entire
            canyon wall crumbled, collapsing several hundred meters inward.
            Cracks began to spread all over the wall like spider webs.
          </p>
          <p>
            It had only been moments ago since Chu Kuangren began using his raw
            strength to fight Jiu Yan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, the raw strength that he had showcased dumbfounded
            every sky-pride at the scene. None of them could believe what they
            had just witnessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The raw strength of an almighty archaic ancient beast had been
            overpowered!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the beginning of time, an archaic ancient wild beast’s raw
            strength had always been something that every cultivator dreamt of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without spiritual power or divine powers, they could dominate the
            realm with raw strength alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            There had never been a cultivator who dared to battle a wild beast
            using raw strength only. Even cultivators who specialize in
            cultivating their physique would not attempt that. It was an
            unwritten rule in the cultivation world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet now, Chu Kuangren has broken this rule in front of everybody
            with just a punch and a kick.
          </p>
          <p>
            He proved that human cultivators could use their physical bodies to
            oppress wild beasts too!!
          </p>
          <p>“What a freak!!”</p>

            Bai Hongyu, Xiao Jingchen, and the others could not help but
            exclaim.
          </p>
          <p>“I am going to rip your lungs out!!”</p>
          <p>
            From a distance, Jiu Yan, who had crashed into the canyon, let out a
            furious scowl. Then, an incredibly magnificent Water and Fire energy
            poured out from his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            This terrifying Water and Fire energy spread out rapidly,
            disintegrating everything around him!
          </p>
          <p>“Water and Fire Divine Power, Lava Snake!!”</p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan howled in fury, and a crimson flame erupted into a huge fire
            python, which bit its way furiously toward Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sheer power from this attack alone was almost equivalent to the
            top-notch Boundary Emperors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren grinned and said with a smile, “You can’t beat me in
            physicality, yet you want to play the cultivation level game? Oh
            well. I’m still going to crush you anyway!”
          </p>
          <p>
            With the lift of an arm, immense spiritual qi surged toward him like
            ocean waves.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he unleashed a palm technique, the cultivators at the scene
            were overwhelmed with grief.
          </p>
          <p>It was the Emperor Technique, the Palm of Sorrow!</p>
          <p>
            The strength from the Palm of Sorrow instantly smashed a good half
            of the fire python broken. Its dreadful strength qi continued
            radiating in all directions, forcing the cultivators in its
            proximity to use their spiritual power to defend themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What kind of Dao does this guy cultivate? How does he manage to
            muster such terrifying power by using completely different classes
            of techniques?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The group of outlawed sky-prides stared at Chu Kuangren, feeling
            somewhat baffled.
          </p>
          <p>
            As outlawed sky-prides, they had already discovered their own
            respective Daos, much like other Boundary Emperors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Logically speaking, only techniques that were compatible with their
            Dao could exhibit their powers’ maximum potential. This was why
            Boundary Emperors would much rather use their own self-created
            Boundary Emperor Techniques instead of Emperor Techniques. The same
            could be said about these outlawed sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Chu Kuangren had been using several types of techniques,
            and he was somehow able to unleash terrifying combat strengths
            through each one of those. This made the crowd completely dazed as
            to which kind of Dao he specialized in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan could not care less about which Dao Chu Kuangren cultivated
            anymore. His attacks had been destroyed by his opponent, and he had
            taken the brunt of the impact by getting blasted several hundred
            meters backward. As such, he roared fiercely and activated his
            divine power once more. “Water and Fire Divine Power, Lava Snake,
            Aqua Tiger!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Water- and Fire-based Daoist Rhyme manifested in the sky,
            transforming into a giant fire python and a menacing water tiger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two gushes of terrifying energy waves flanked Chu Kuangren from both
            left and right, biting their way toward his direction.
          </p>
          <p>“Sword qi clones!”</p>
          <p>
            Even in face of such a tricky technique, Chu Kuangren remained
            composed as usual.
          </p>
          <p>
            A streak of sword qi manifested on his body. To everyone’s
            amazement, it agglomerated into a sword qi clone that looked
            identical to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren and the sword qi clone both drew out a sword strike
            simultaneously, neutralizing Jiu Yan’s attack effortlessly.
          </p>
          <p>“A cloning technique?!”</p>
          <p>
            “Yet another class of technique. Also, the power of his clone is so
            strong that it can take on Jiu Yan’s attack.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The more the crowd watched on, the more unpredictable Chu Kuangren
            was to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amongst all outlawed sky-prides, Jiu Yan was considered one of the
            strongest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, despite giving his all, he was not able to gain any high ground
            in his battle with Chu Kuangren. On the contrary, Chu Kuangren
            looked pretty relaxed ever since the battle began.
          </p>

            Aside

          <p></p>
          <p>“D*mn it. How does he have such terrifying power?!”</p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan’s expression looked grim. Since he began his cultivation
            journey, this was his first time feeling such terrifying power from
            a human cultivator.
          </p>
          <p>
            His opponent had clearly outclassed him in every attack he threw at
            him, leaving him at a complete loss!
          </p>
          <p>“Are you guys just going to watch on?”</p>
          <p>
            At this moment, Chu Kuangren suddenly spoke. His words were not
            meant for Jiu Yan, but for Wang Quan, Bai Hongyu, Touheng, and the
            few other outlawed sky-prides who were standing not far away.
          </p>
          <p>The few of them exchanged glances when they heard what he said</p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist said calmly, “Whichever one of you is confident enough
            to beat him in solo combat, please go ahead.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After witnessing how Chu Kuangren outmuscled Jiu Yan’s combat
            strength, none of them dared to dream of beating him anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s all attack him together. We can settle this guy first, then
            think of how to divide this land!”
          </p>
          <p>Wang Quan suggested.</p>
          <p>
            Besides Jiu Yan, Wang Quan himself had also exchanged two moves with
            Chu Kuangren before. Although it was only two moves, the wound on
            his palm had yet to recover.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s incredible combat strength was enough to convince him
            that the former was not someone whom the outlawed sky-prides could
            defeat in solo combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Not even that so-called reincarnation of a great Emperor, Qin
            Tianchen could match his level.”
          </p>
          <p>Wang Quan said to himself.</p>
          <p>
            After that, he took the initiative and made his move first. In the
            air behind him, five-colored flashes of brilliance circulated and
            integrated into an enormous five-colored light wheel.
          </p>
          <p>
            That five-colored light wheel spun in the air, and streaks of light
            shot out from above, increasing the energy on Wang Quan’s body
            substantially.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, I’ll show you the greatness of my Five Colored Divine
            Wheel!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wang Quan scoffed out loud and said. The Five Colored Divine Wheel
            was a divine power that he had mastered naturally. It was this
            divine power that regarded him as the cultivator who was most suited
            to cultivate the Five Ways Dao in the entire Wang clan’s history.
            Even some of the Boundary Emperors in the Wang clan could not
            surpass his mastery in terms of Five Ways Dao.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, you and I still need to settle our score. We shall
            proceed with it here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu let out a low cry, and the bright red armor on her began
            circulating with Daoist Rhyme, which made her energy increase
            continuously.
          </p>
          <p>
            She drew out a long crimson saber that had vivid draconic markings
            on it. The saber emitted an extremely vicious ferocious qi.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ll have a go at you too!”</p>
          <p>
            Touheng from the Underworld Demonic Realm stepped forward as well.
            The eerie demonic qi flowing around him emanated into the
            atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, Chu Kuangren, I shall see how far your Exquisite Nine
            Orifices Sword Heart is at too.”

          <p>Sword Daoist took a step forward with his menacing sword qi.</p>
          <p>
            Four great outlawed sky-prides unleashed their Daoist Rhymes
            altogether, and their energies locked down onto Chu Kuangren all at
            once.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sky-prides around them were astonished to see that.
            Instinctively, they all retreated backward out of fear that they
            would be hurt from the repercussions of the battle that was about to
            commence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The edge of Chu Kuangren’s lip raised slightly into a grin as he
            hooked his finger and signaled at his group of challengers. “Come.
            Show me what you outlawed sky-prides are really made of.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Having to face five of them all by himself, Chu Kuangren showed no
            signs of weakness in his poise. In fact, he was confident and
            arrogant enough to issue them this challenge.
          </p>
          <p>“Strike!”</p>
          <p>
            Wang Quan led the pack and opened the attack. With a fist technique
            unleashed, the dazzling Five Ways Light instantly burst out,
            sweeping toward Chu Kuangren along with a terrifying wave of
            spiritual power.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword ray on the Descendant Self Sword in Chu Kuangren’s grip
            glinted. With a lift of his sword, piercing sword rays poured out at
            his opponent and instantly shattered the Five Ways Light.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sword ray landed onto Wang Quan’s body, lambasting him nearly a
            hundred meters out in an instant. n0𝔳𝞮𝐥𝗎𝓈𝚋.𝑐0𝐦
          </p>
          <p>
            What followed soon after came from Chu Kuangren’s side, where a
            surge of majestic Water and Fire energy blasted toward his
            direction. It came from Jiu Yan.
          </p>
          <p>However, Chu Kuangren paid no heed to this attack.</p>
          <p>
            That was because the sword qi clone beside him was already reacting
            to it. With a draw of a sword, the clone dispelled the Water and
            Fire energy, then leaped toward Jiu Yan’s direction to continue
            battling him.
          </p>
          <p>
            This sword qi clone might not be as strong as Chu Kuangren, but it
            sufficed facing an enemy like Jiu Yan.
          </p>
          <p>“Heavenly Worship Saber Art!”</p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu lifted the long crimson saber that she was holding into
            the air, unleashing an incredibly terrifying crimson saber ray.
            Amongst the ray of light were Daoist Transformations of gods and
            demons kneeling to worship the heavens.
          </p>
          <p>
            These were the Heavenly Worship Saber Art and Heavenly Worship Seal
            — the most top-notch Emperor Techniques of the Bai clan.
          </p>
          <p>Bai Hongyu’s path of Dao was a domineering one!</p>

            She had discovered this Dao from those two Emperor Techniques.
            Hence, she was able to unleash extremely powerful combat strength by
            using those two Emperor Techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            The crimson saber light shot down from the sky, almost ripping the
            fabric of space around them apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            That Daoist Transformation of gods and demons worshipping emitted a
            boundless domineering aura that encased Chu Kuangren within.
          </p>
          <p>“Tathagata Rebirth Mantra!”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren did not try to evade. Instead, a merciful expression
            was suddenly seen on his face. It was as if he had transformed into
            a Buddha from the heavens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terrifying golden Buddhist Light emerged from his body, taking the
            whole realm by shock.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amidst the Buddhist light, a giant ancient Buddha manifested.
            Wrapped in an immense Buddhist Light, the Buddha’s hands extended
            out horizontally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with a deafening sound, the combination of the Buddhist Light
            and saber strength formed a gush of crimson-gold qi rays, which
            swept across the whole land, shocking the realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren and Bai Hongyu were the ones who had to bear the brunt
            of that impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite having the protection of Boundary Emperor Armor, the immense
            energy of the blast wave hurled Bai Hongyu off her foot and sent her
            flying backward.

          <p>
            Chu Kuangren, on the other hand, merely got pushed back several
            meters. He gently brushed off the dust at the front of his robe. His
            Supreme Sage body remained unscathed!
          </p>
          <p>“Wind of the Sword!”</p>
          <p>
            Bai Hongyu’s technique had just only gone over, yet Sword Daoist’s
            sword qi was already fast approaching. The two techniques connected
            seamlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it were any other cultivator, they would not be able to
            reactivate their spiritual power in time and hit out another round
            under such circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, besides having spiritual power, Chu Kuangren also had
            his incredible mind power!
          </p>
          <p>
            As his formless mind power surged out, pieces of mysterious runes
            condensed all around Chu Kuangren to form an indestructible runic
            wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sword qi intertwined and struck the runic wall, producing a series
            of loud bangs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The runic wall eventually crumbled, but Sword Daoist’s sword qi
            still dealt no damage to Chu Kuangren at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sword Daoist, you’re way too weak. Why don’t you just step aside
            and let others lead the charge?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said condescendingly. With the lift of an arm, his
            formless mind power constructed runes after runes, producing
            countless runic swords in the void, one after another.
          </p>
          <p>Frost Runic Sword, Flame Runic Sword, Wind Runic Sword...</p>
          <p>
            Countless runic swords rained down like a heavy downpour and
            converged into a colossal torrent, which gushed toward Sword Daoist
            with divine splendor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though Sword Daoist’s combat strength had improved in recent
            days, he still felt unprecedented pressure before such overwhelming
            power.
          </p>
          <p>“Wind of the Sword!!”</p>
          <p>
            The Sword Daoist roared and cast his sword technique to the maximum.
          </p>
          <p>
            His sword qi swept over the place like an endless violent gust, but
            they were all shattered by the thousands of runic energies.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Sword Daoist could do little to overcome such a scale of
            energy, he was instantly hammered into the earth beneath him.
          </p>
          <p>It took only one move!</p>
          <p>He had lost in just one move yet again!</p>
          <p>
            No matter how much the Sword Daoist had improved himself, he was
            still no match to Chu Kuangren’s one move!
          </p>
          <p>
            His opponent’s combat strength sent cold shivers down everyone’s
            spine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than horrifying, they could not think of any other adjective
            to describe such combat strength.
          </p>
          <p>“Chu Kuangren, take this!!”</p>
          <p>
            Just then, a loud sound echoed in the sky. A tremendous demonic qi
            erupted to form a demonic qi whirlpool spanning over a kilometer in
            diameter!
          </p>
          <p>
            At the very center of the whirlpool, a giant purple demonic eye
            opened abruptly, gazing coldly at Chu Kuangren beneath. It emanated
            with a domineering poise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the demonic eye, boundless demonic qi surrounded Touheng. He,
            too, was staring at Chu Kuangren coldly.
          </p>
          <p>“Demonic Eye of Oblivion, destroy him!!”</p>
          <p>
            The moment he finished speaking, the Demonic Eye of Oblivion blasted
            out a purple demonic ray with its aim directly at Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            This demonic ray contained terrifying oblivion energy. Wherever it
            passed, the fabrics of space would twist, and the beings around it
            would pulverize!
          </p>

        <div class="chapters">
          <h4>

            Disappointment

          <p></p>
          <p>“Demonic Eye of Oblivion!!”</p>
          <p>
            Touheng, the demon outlawed sky-pride, activated his strongest kill
            skill whilst the other outlawed sky-prides kept Chu Kuangren
            occupied.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diabolical demonic eye appeared on top of the sky, and appalling
            demonic rays blasted down from above, locking down at Chu Kuangren.
            Wherever it passed by, fabrics of space were shattered and living
            beings were pulverized
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite facing such power, Chu Kuangren remained calm as always, not
            showing any sense of fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of a sudden, incredibly ruthless ferocious qi fluctuations
            erupted from his body and shot up into the sky. Then, it turned into
            a frightening avatar.
          </p>
          <p>It was Chu Kuangren’s Divine Ferocious Avatar! n0𝗏ℯ𝑳𝔲𝗌𝒷.𝒸0𝓶</p>
          <p>
            He had improved his Infallible Tormented Physique to the perfected
            form long ago. Adding that to his Supreme Sage body, the sheer poise
            that he displayed was extremely intimidating!
          </p>
          <p>
            A loud battle cry reverberated in the realm, and its bone-piercing
            battle intent shook the entire land.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Divine Ferocious Avatar raised his arm and smacked toward the
            demonic ray in the sky. Tremendous ferocious qi battle intent
            amassed into a qi beam.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a bang, the ferocious qi beam and demonic ray clashed
            violently. The entire Spiritual Qi Leyline was sent into a shockwave
            that it had never experienced before.
          </p>
          <p>
            As dreadful blast waves spread out, even the outlawed sky-prides
            were forced to use their spiritual power to protect themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the ferocious qi ripped the demonic ray apart, and then
            it lambasted onto that purple demonic eye up in the sky. As a loud
            buzzing sound rang out, the demonic eye was obliterated!!
          </p>
          <p>The Divine Ferocious Avatar slowly faded out of existence.</p>
          <p>
            In the same spot stood Chu Kuangren, who was breathing at a normal
            pace. His expression was as calm as usual, as if none of his energy
            was spent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sheer terror of his Foundation Level had already reached
            immeasurable heights.
          </p>
          <p>Gulp...</p>
          <p>
            Countless people gulped nervously, in awe as to the unbelievable
            sight that they had just witnessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart and Infallible Tormented
            Physique... Two Supreme Daoist Physiques?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Adding that to the Foundation Level that comes with his Supreme
            Sage body, the raw strength that his physical body can produce is
            just... monstrous!”
          </p>
          <p>Even the outlawed sky-prides shuddered at the thought of that.</p>
          <p>
            The power that Chu Kuangren showcased almost exceeded the upper
            limit of what they imagined a sky-pride could do.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that all you so-called outlawed sky-prides are capable of?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren said nonchalantly. There was a hint of disappointment
            in his voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            He felt that he had already lowered his expectations by a lot. He
            did not wish for someone among his peers who could make him give his
            all, but they should at least offer someone whom he could treat
            seriously!

          <p>
            Yet in the end, all he got was Sword Daoist, Bai Hongyu, archaic
            beast Nine-Headed Snakelet...
          </p>
          <p>
            These outlawed sky-prides, who were at the pinnacle of sky-prides,
            could not even get him to move more than a finger, let alone get him
            to use his full strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noticing the disappointment in Chu Kuangren’s tone, Sword Daoist and
            the few other sky-prides could not help but frown. They felt
            extremely frustrated.
          </p>
          <p>Bam...</p>
          <p>
            Just then, a figure swooped down from the sky above, creating a
            massive crater on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>That figure was Jiu Yan.</p>
          <p>
            He laid motionless inside the deep crater, looking miserable. There
            were bloodied sword qi cuts all over his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            While standing atop the crater was Chu Kuangren’s sword qi clone.
            The clone looked cold and emotionless, much like a divine entity
            staring down at a mere mortal.
          </p>
          <p>“D*mn you. D*mn you!!</p>
          <p>
            In his eyes were extremely fury, bitter resentment, and utter
            disbelief at the state he was put in.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was not just anybody. He was an outlawed sky-pride amongst the
            archaic ancient wild beast race!!
          </p>
          <p>
            His combat strength was ranked among the highest of all outlawed
            sky-prides, and yet, he was beaten by one of Chu Kuangren’s mere
            sword qi clones. That was just way too staggering for him!
          </p>
          <p>
            Those people who realized this fact felt relieved that they were not
            the ones who had to bear his brunt. Nevertheless, they were even
            more fearful of Chu Kuangren now.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that guy really just a sky-pride?”</p>
          <p>“Could he be a disguise of one of those immortal freaks?!”</p>
          <p>“No way. Those old freaks would never attack sky-prides.”</p>
          <p>
            “But such combat strength... not even Qin Tianchen, that so-called
            reincarnation of a Great Emperor from the Qin clan has such power,
            does he?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sword Dao, runic Dao, Buddhist Dao... What kind of Dao does he
            specialize in, really?”
          </p>
          <p>
            All the sky-prides were engaged in a heated discussion, all the
            while gazing at that white-robed figure. They felt like they would
            never forget today’s event for the rest of their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            One person alone could overpower five outlawed sky-prides so
            effortlessly. His brilliance was unmatched.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let me repeat it again. I’m calling dibs on the treasures along
            this whole leyline!”
          </p>
          <p>“Now, do any of you still have any objections?”</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren swept a glance across everybody at the scene. The
            chilling domineering aura that he emitted was so overwhelming that
            the crowd was almost choked breathless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hypothetically speaking, if these outlawed sky-prides were two
            levels above them, Chu Kuangren would then be two levels above the
            outlawed sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            If these people had no guts to enrage outlawed sky-prides, then what
            more Chu Kuangren?
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s just retreat.”</p>
          <p>
            “This guy’s power has already surpassed anyone’s expectation. He’s
            not someone whom you, me, or anyone in this room can fight against.”
          </p>

            “These treasures may be great, but we need to be alive to enjoy them
            in the first place.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowd exchanged glances, and they immediately stepped out of the
            Spiritual Qi Leyline obediently.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a short while, the lively Spiritual Qi Leyline became empty and
            quiet once more as nobody dared to step foot inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following that, Chu Kuangren looked toward Bai Hongyu, Wang Quan,
            and the few other sky-prides who were standing not far away from
            him.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s the matter? Do you guys want to continue battling?”</p>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, now that you’ve conquered this whole leyline, aren’t
            you afraid that you’ll be surrounded and slaughtered by all those
            orthodoxies of Emperor Road once you step out of the Enchanted
            Forest Realm?”
          </p>
          <p>Wang Quan remarked with an ice-cold gaze.</p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren chuckled when he heard that. “Why? Just because you
            can’t beat me on your own, you’re now using those orthodoxies behind
            you to intimidate me? Is this how you outlawed sky-prides usually
            behave?”
          </p>
          <p>Getting surrounded and then slaughtered?</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren was already familiar with such a threat.</p>
          <p>
            Back in Firmament Star, he had long since been used to being
            attacked by groups. Even if they do it again here, would it be a
            problem?
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on what he gathered, the real powerhouses on Emperor Road were
            those powerful Sovereigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, because those Sovereigns had lived for far too long, they
            had been restricted by some sort of law of nature in the Emperor
            Road. Hence, they did not have the freedom to cause harm to
            sky-prides as they wished. Otherwise, their course into the Heavenly
            Deterioration Stage Five state would be accelerated. As such, Chu
            Kuangren was bold enough to claim this whole leyline as his own.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, don’t burn bridges. Do you really have to be so
            extreme?”
          </p>
          <p>Sword Daoist warned him sternly.</p>
          <p>“Is there still a bridge between me and the Sword Tribe?”</p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren felt even more amused at the Sword Daoist’s words.</p>
          <p>
            He did not even bother explaining further before he immediately
            lifted his hand. An incredibly terrifying Sword-based Daoist Rhyme
            began to emanate from his body. “Consider this my last warning.
            Leave, or die!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The group of sky-prides stared at each other blankly. In the end,
            they were left with no choice but to surrender and leave.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing the treasures that filled the land, they were very reluctant.
            However, there was nothing they could do about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the crowd had dissipated, Chu Kuangren mobilized his spiritual
            thought and shrouded it over a good half of the leyline. All sorts
            of treasures were seen flying in his direction as if a huge
            invisible hand was grabbing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren opened his Yin and Yang Ring, and countless treasures
            flew into it like moths drawn to fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were all kinds of herbs and spiritual fruits, and the sight of
            it made the crowd stare and gulp enviously.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Look! That’s an Emperor-grade herb, the Divine Spiritual
            Dragonwood. Rumor has it that this herb can greatly increase a
            cultivator’s spiritual power capacity.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Not just the Divine Spiritual Dragonwood, but there are also the
            Mica Gemstone, Heavenly Monarch Herb, and many more... My gosh, even
            the poorest quality among them are Boundary Emperor-grade
            treasures.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Now they have all been collected by one person. Good grief. This
            guy is just way too scary now isn’t it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Every sky-pride looked on helplessly as the countless treasures flew
            into Chu Kuangren’s Yin and Yang Ring. They could not help but feel
            an agonizing heartache.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were so many herbs there. Even if having a small portion of it
            would turn their fortunes around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, Chu Kuangren did not look like he was going to give
            them a cut of any of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            His action was akin to gobbling down every morsel of the food,
            leaving not even the gravy for the others to taste.

          <h4>
            Chapter 549: Another Three Arrives, Leng Ningyu’s Odd Expression
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>“This guy’s such a bastard!</p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist was so infuriated that he gritted hard on his teeth as
            he watched Chu Kuangren collect all the treasures in the entire
            Spiritual Qi Leyline.
          </p>
          <p>It felt like déjà vu.</p>
          <p>
            He felt that ever since he met Chu Kuangren, he was constrained at
            every turn and was always defeated.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, it began with Chu Kuangren defeating him in one move on
            multiple occasions. After that, the White Spiritual Divine Fruit
            that he had so painstakingly searched for was snatched by Chu
            Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the Spiritual Qi Leyline that was supposed to be divided among
            him and the few other outlawed sky-prides had been taken by Chu
            Kuangren as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The extent of his combat strength is unfathomable. I don’t
            understand how he has such insane combat strength.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan stared forlornly at Chu Kuangren. In his mind, scenes of Chu
            Kuangren crushing him in battle flashed vividly...
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren had overpowered a wild beast with raw strength,
            possessed more sophisticated swordsmanship skills than Sword Daoist,
            and even had enigmatic runic skills and endless Emperor
            Techniques...
          </p>
          <p>
            Chu Kuangren’s every performance in battle had exceeded their
            understanding of a sky-pride’s supposed capability.
          </p>
          <p>
            They even began to suspect if his combat strength was already
            comparable with a Sovereign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although outlawed sky-prides were powerful, most of them could only
            match the prowess of Boundary Emperors. There was still quite a big
            gap between them and the Sovereigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            They had never heard of any outlawed sky-pride who could compete
            with Sovereigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each sky-pride at the scene could only watch helplessly as Chu
            Kuangren freely looted all sorts of treasures from the Spiritual Qi
            Leyline.
          </p>
          <p>This feeling was torturing for them.</p>
          <p>Right at this moment.</p>
          <p>
            Several flashes of light glided past the sky. Incredibly ruthless
            energies emanated from their bodies, and they did not seem any
            weaker than the few other outlawed sky-prides here.
          </p>
          <p>This group of people consisted of two men and one woman.</p>
          <p>
            One of the men did not have a top on, which exposed his muscular
            upper body. His tanned skin emitted a faint glow of gold and
            iron-like color. He had two horns on his head and a nose ring
            piercing through his nostrils. Judging by his appearance, he may
            look blunt, but the vicious ferocious qi permeating his body was in
            no way weaker than Jiu Yan’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other person wore a long black robe, with a pale, almost sickly
            face. The aura he gave out had an indescribable peculiarity to it.
            n0𝐯𝗲𝐥𝑢𝑠𝓑.𝑐0𝓂
          </p>
          <p>
            At a closer look, this young man’s eyes were very enchanting, just
            like a pair of amethyst. Occasionally, mysterious runic energies
            glinted across those eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last member of the group was a gorgeous woman with waist-length
            luscious black hair. Her skin was smooth as silk, and she had a
            slender figure. There was indescribable cold energy radiating from
            her. However, it was not the kind of coldness that made her
            unapproachable. It was the kind of indifference that made one feel
            undeserving of her attention.

            “It’s them. Niu Dali from the Archaic Bull Demon Tribe, Zi Wuji from
            the Runic Lands, and Leng Ningyu, the Maiden Sage of Seven Emotions
            Sect!”
          </p>
          <p>“Three more outlawed sky-prides. I think we’re in for a treat.”</p>
          <p>
            “These three people’s powers are by no means weaker than Sword
            Daoist and company. Especially Zi Wuji, his techniques are extremely
            bizarre, always managing to strike fear in people’s hearts.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The sky-prides at the scene were astonished by the arrival of these
            three outlawed sky-prides.
          </p>
          <p>
            The three newcomers seemed pretty puzzled by what they were seeing
            here as well.
          </p>
          <p>What was this that they were seeing?</p>
          <p>
            An incredibly fine-looking young man was in the midst of collecting
            all the Spiritual Qi Leyline’s treasures, while the rest of the
            sky-prides were merely watching from the sidelines?!
          </p>
          <p>
            This included Sword Daoist and the few other outlawed sky-prides
            too.
          </p>
          <p>The more they looked at it, the stranger this sight seemed.</p>
          <p>What was going on?</p>
          <p>
            Were these sky-prides not interested in the Spiritual Qi Leyline’s
            treasures at all?
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, you with the nine heads, what’s happening here?”</p>
          <p>
            Niu Dali of the Demon Bull Tribe glared at Jiu Yan and asked with an
            interrogative look in his gaze.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way he spoke to him was rather rude. It looked like this was not
            the first time he and Jiu Yan had crossed paths. Either way, their
            relationship seemed pretty rocky.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. If you want the answer so badly, why don’t you go and ask
            that guy there yourself?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan scoffed back at him, then stared back at Chu Kuangren. There
            was a spiteful look in his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not just him, but the rest of the sky-prides looked at Chu Kuangren
            the same way too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Niu Dali may look like an honest person, but he was by no means
            gullible. He could instantly tell that Chu Kuangren was not just
            anybody whom they could dispose of easily. The treasures he had may
            be alluring, but he knew better than to act hastily.
          </p>
          <p>“Ningyu, you’re here.”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing that Leng Ningyu had arrived, Sword Daoist deliberately
            tidied up his appearance and then stepped forward with a warm smile
            on his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other sky-prides did not look too surprised when they saw his
            reaction
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that Sword Daoist had a crush on Leng Ningyu and that he
            was currently pursuing her was not really a secret among the society
            of sky-prides in Emperor Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the part that made the least sense to them in this saga was
            that Leng Ningyu cultivated the Unruffled Emotions Dao, so her
            emotions were flat most of the time. Not to mention her lack of
            response toward Sword Daoist’s affections, she might not even
            understand the concept of love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, everything that Sword Daoist had done for her was merely
            one-sided. His unreciprocated love for her would never bear any
            fruit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, Sword Daoist remained loyal to his ways, spending all of
            his time trying to think of ways to gain her attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist had become what many would call a simp — a fool caught
            in unrequited love.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>“Yes. Hello, Brother Sword Daoist.”</p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu replied flatly after taking a glance at Sword Daoist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist was not surprised at all. It was obvious he had been
            through similarly awkward many instances. Facing Leng Ningyu, his
            ego was non-existent.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, immediately after that, he seemed to notice something
            amiss, and his facial expression changed abruptly.
          </p>
          <p>
            He realized that Leng Ningyu — who had never reacted toward men, or
            more accurately, toward anyone — had been fixing her gaze on Chu
            Kuangren ever since she arrived.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, there was an inexplicable affection hidden within
            her gaze.
          </p>
          <p>“Ningyu?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yes? Do you have anything you’d like to ask me, Brother Sword
            Daoist?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu looked at Sword Daoist, her gaze returning to the usual
            coldness.
          </p>
          <p>“You know Chu Kuangren?”</p>
          <p>
            “You mean, this Brother who’s currently collecting all the leyline
            treasures? Yes, indeed I do. He saved my life once.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu said calmly before she fixed her gaze onto Chu Kuangren
            once again, and that indescribable endearment inside her eyes
            surfaced once more.
          </p>
          <p>Upon seeing that, Sword Daoist’s expression became gloomy.</p>
          <p>
            Ever since the first time he set eyes on Leng Ningyu, he had been
            deeply attracted to her gentle temperament. Thus, he began his
            relentless pursuit of her. Nevertheless, after so many years, he
            still could not garner any positive outcome. Leng Ningyu still
            treated him like she would to any other stranger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet now, she seemed to have developed some kind of fondness toward
            this Chu Kuangren whom she had just met not long ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            This kind of stark contrast that she had for someone else other than
            him made the fury inside Sword Daoist’s heart burn even more
            intensely.
          </p>
          <p>This was the first time he had so much hate for someone.</p>
          <p>
            His nemesis had not only repeatedly humiliated him in public and
            robbed him of his Opportunities of Fortune, but now, he even wanted
            to snatch away the one true love of his life?!
          </p>
          <p>
            At the thought of that, a raging fire of resentment brewed within
            Sword Daoist’s heart. This feeling was almost driving him insane.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sky-prides beside them were beginning to sense something amiss
            too. Their gazes alternated to and fro between Chu Kuangren and Leng
            Ningyu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Close to a dozen images of heroes rescuing damsels were playing
            inside their heads.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, regardless if he was the hero to her damsel in distress,
            Leng Ningyu should, by right, not be moved so easily because she
            cultivated the Unruffled Emotions Dao.
          </p>
          <p>“Is Chu Kuangren’s good looks too much to handle?”</p>
          <p>
            A few of the cultivators stared at Chu Kuangren. The longer they
            looked at him, the more they concurred that his looks were truly
            otherworldly.
          </p>
          <p>
            That gentlemanly demeanor and that handsome face of his mesmerized
            everyone at the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This person does have extraordinary looks. I reckon that nine out
            of ten females who see that pretty face would immediately find
            themselves bewitched.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Rightfully so. No wonder Leng Ningyu is drawn to him. It seems like
            not even the Unruffled Emotions Dao can resist Chu Kuangren’s charm.
            This handsome face of his has managed to defy all laws!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Tsk tsk. With incredible combat strength, exquisite talent, and
            such top-quality looks, who could resist?”

          <h4>
            Chapter 550: Wood Elemental Leyline Essence, Combining Forces Again
          </h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The odd change in Leng Ningyu’s expression made the crowd speculate,
            and many of them looked enviously at Chu Kuangren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leng Ningyu was not just anybody. She was a cultivator who
            cultivated the Unruffled Emotions Dao. The fact he could draw the
            attention of a character like her showed that his charm was on
            another level.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Tsk tsk. So long as he desires, I reckon he can win over many women
            in this world, don’t you think?”
          </p>
          <p>Zhan Hongying exclaimed admirably amongst the crowd.</p>
          <p>
            She did not harbor any wishful thinking toward Chu Kuangren because
            she had nothing but reverence for this person.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The man who has stolen my heart truly has his marvels. Shame is
            that someone of my standards would never stand a chance to be with
            him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In the middle of the crowd, Feng Yaorao glanced at Chu Kuangren
            fondly. Yet, soon after, she shook her head and snapped herself back
            into reality. She felt a slight grievance at her improbable dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for Chu Kuangren himself, he never really bothered about all the
            adoration that he was receiving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, he was focused on gathering all the treasures from the
            Spiritual Qi Leyline.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Spiritual Qi Leyline spanned over ten kilometers and contained
            countless precious treasures within. The number of treasures there
            was unfathomable. Even by using his mind power, it would take Chu
            Kuangren a significant amount of time to collect it all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as Chu Kuangren was halfway through collecting them, a quake
            spread out from within the Spiritual Qi Leyline again.
          </p>
          <p>Wobble, wobble!!</p>
          <p>
            As soon as the leyline began trembling, a new crack began to form at
            one end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked toward that crack in the ground with visible shock
            in their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s this? Has some kind of treasure resurfaced again?”</p>
          <p>
            “Gosh, this is too scary. The treasures here are already abundant.
            Is there going to be more?”
          </p>
          <p>“I wonder what it is.”</p>
          <p>
            A green light was seen seeping through the crack, and a gush of
            green-colored qi pillared skyward, forming a gigantic dragon that
            flew menacingly amidst the sky.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the sky-prides were shocked to see it.</p>
          <p>“A dragon formed from earth qi... Is this a Dragon Leyline?!”</p>
          <p>
            “Oh my, a Dragon Leyline is the highest quality of all leylines.
            What kind of treasure has this leyline produced now?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The earth qi that surged out from the crack on the ground
            transformed into a menacing dragon, which flew in the sky and then
            self-destructed. It then dissipated into the clouds, dyeing a whole
            half of the horizon into a vibrant hue of green.
          </p>
          <div id="pf-3058-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914dfd5ed68b00364a4a98",
                id: "pf-3058-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the treasures hidden within the crack in the ground began
            to surface at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a pool of green soul sap, almost the height of a man.
            Boundless Daoist Rhyme billowed around it, swirling wildly like a
            dragon and phoenix. It was an auspicious anomaly.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this soul sap showed up, a gush of vitality emitted outward.
            Flowers began to blossom all around it, while all sorts of flora
            sprouted frenziedly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the blink of an eye, a hundred meters radius from the green soul
            sap turned into a lush forest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such an incredible phenomenon dumbfounded everyone at the scene.
          </p>
          <p>“This is Wood Elemental Leyline Essence!!”</p>
          <p>
            Sword Daoist exclaimed in shock when he saw that pool of green
            fluid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wood Elemental Leyline Essence referred to the essence within a
            leyline. Under normal circumstances, a leyline would very rarely
            produce its very own essence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even in instances where they did, the essence produced would only be
            as big as the size of a fist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowd had certainly never heard of such a large-sized essence,
            much less seen one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just this pool of leyline essence alone would be worth more than all
            the treasures found in the leyline.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If I could absorb this leyline essence, my combat strength would
            increase by two levels at least. By that time, I’d most certainly
            attain Sovereign-level combat strength.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s easier said than done to absorb such huge amounts of leyline
            essence. One would need approximately a year’s time to complete such
            a feat. Still, improving to a Sovereign combat strength in just a
            year is still too big of an Opportunity of Fortune to let go of!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Besides, this Wood Elemental Leyline Essence is undoubtedly the
            most top-notch Healing Spiritual Herb in this world. No matter how
            heavy the injuries, a few drops of this Wood Elemental Leyline
            Essence would ensure that its user recuperates back to full health.
            Do you know how many lives this pool of leyline essence equates
            to?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everybody looked at the pool of Wood Elemental Leyline Essence
            lustfully. Even Leng Ningyu’s gaze started to tremble.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Chu Kuangren, we’re not going to let you have this Wood Elemental
            Leyline Essence all to yourself!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan could not stand it any longer. He morphed back to his
            original form and dashed toward that Wood Elemental Leyline Essence.
            He spread his jaws open wide and attempted to engulf it in whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, they could bear watching Chu Kuangren claim the rest of
            the treasures in the leyline to himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, after witnessing this pool of Wood Elemental Leyline
            Essence, they could not hold back any longer.
          </p>
          <p>It was too precious.</p>
          <p>This Wood Elemental Leyline Essence was just way too precious.</p>
          <p>
            Not to mention sky-prides like them, even those Sovereigns would be
            moved by this item.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Can’t believe a loser like you would dare to steal what belongs to
            me.”
          </p>
          <p>Chu Kuangren muttered indifferently.</p>
          <p>
            He then cast his mind power, constructing a huge silvery-white rune
            in the blank space before him.
          </p>
          <p>Spatial Cessation Rune!</p>
          <div id="pf-3059-1">
            <script>
              window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
              window.pubfuturetag.push({
                unit: "63914e145ed68b00364a4ab9",
                id: "pf-3059-1",
              });
            </script>
          </div>
          <p>
            The rune lambasted down from above and instantly locked Jiu Yan’s
            body into place.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, a terrifying palm strength surged out like a torrent and
            struck onto Jiu Yan’s body brutally, blasting his giant body off his
            feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan spat out a mouthful of blood. Even a mighty wild beast’s
            body could not endure such an attack.
          </p>
          <p>“Rune?”</p>
          <p>“What a majestic spatial rune!”</p>
          <p>
            Not far away, Zi Wuji, the outlawed sky-pride from the Runic Lands,
            expressed his surprise. A mysterious purple runic light flashed
            across his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My dear fellows, you really don’t need me to tell you how valuable
            this Wood Elemental Leyline Essence is. You guys can’t possibly
            allow Chu Kuangren to have it all to himself, can you? Now that we
            have a few more outlawed sky-prides on our side, we should all
            attack him at once. I trust that we have enough manpower to fight
            Chu Kuangren.” Sword Daoist faced the crowd and encouraged them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, he despised Chu Kuangren to the core. Since there was a
            chance for him to lead a combined attack against Chu Kuangren, he
            would surely not let go of this chance so easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            His words made Bai Hongyu, Wang Quan, and company quite tempted.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, when the Bull Demon Tribe’s Niu Dali heard that,
            a strange look was seen on his face. “Are you kidding me? Do we
            really need to go all out against this one guy?”
          </p>
          <p>
            His surprise stemmed from the fact that all of them here were
            outlawed sky-prides. n0𝚟𝔢𝗅𝗎𝗌𝔟.𝑐0𝗆
          </p>
          <p>
            When had they, mighty sky-prides, ever needed to combine forces to
            deal with one person?
          </p>
          <p>That was just outrageous.</p>
          <p>
            “Bull boy, cut that crap of yours. This guy is not someone whom you
            can beat alone. We’ll only stand a chance if all of us attack him
            together.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jiu Yan, who had been flung into the sky earlier, sprang back into
            the scene. Ferocious qi was swirling around his body, and his nine
            heads let out a series of furious growls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Niu Dali was slightly taken aback by that. “Nine heads, are you that
            afraid of him too?”
          </p>
          <p>
            He then looked at Chu Kuangren with his curiosity piqued. After
            that, a mischievous smile broke out on his face. “Now, I’m more
            intrigued as to how powerful this guy really is.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like what Sword Daoist said, there was no way they would watch
            Chu Kuangren claim this Wood Elemental Leyline Essence to himself
            just like that.
          </p>
          <p>Bam!</p>
          <p>
            Niu Dali took a stride forward, crossing several hundred meters in
            one breath. The moment he arrived before Chu Kuangren, he unleashed
            a fist technique at his opponent, generating an incredibly
            horrifying qi wave in the space between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that, Chu Kuangren did not flinch at all. Likewise, he
            returned with a fist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two fists clashed with each other with force, just like two
            meteors crashing into each other, producing a deafening sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ground underneath Chu Kuangren and Niu Dali’s feet collapsed
            inward and formed a giant crater. With the two as the center, cracks
            began spreading outward in all directions, covering over several
            hundred meters radius of land. Each of those cracks was several
            dozen meters deep, and they looked as if they were numerous valleys.
            The landscape around them had experienced a tremendous
            transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What a sturdy raw strength. I can’t believe he’s as strong as I am.
            Is he really human?”
          </p>
          <p>Niu Dali’s expression changed slightly.</p>
          <p>
            He hailed from the Archaic Bull Demon Tribe, so the raw strength of
            his physical body was one of the strongest amongst all wild beasts.
            Yet now, he could not even subdue a mere human!
          </p>
          <p>
            He could finally sense the incredibly appalling power within that
            seemingly slender and frail body of Chu Kuangren’s!
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a force with a magnitude not inferior to his. It might even
            be a force that surpassed him in terms of strength!
